Probably a bit too late considering the film released in cinemas more than a month ago; Vikram was a smash hit down south but didn't muster an encouraging response in its Hindi dubbed version which is quite surprising as I found it top notch and significantly better than the Southern fare like Pushpa (2021), RRR (2022) and KGF Chapter 2 (2022) which broke records in the Hindi belt.

There was no story line, no comedy,  three hours of dragging and by the end, I became restless.  I am sure Kamal can do better than this, given his previous track record.
