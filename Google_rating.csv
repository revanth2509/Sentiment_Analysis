What is good in this show is 
VJS, He acting was villainous and comical at the same time.
Camerawork and stunt choreography  of movie was really good.
Agent Tina moment was quite good but ended too quick.

What did not work for me:
Over hype movie was not really worth the hype.
Too many characters
Too many unwanted scenes  long draggy.
The baby character was really annoying which rare as babies are easy lovable.
There is no wow moment in this flim in kaithi the use of gatling gun was reall ...More"," Rated 3.0 out of 5, "

Music, background score, camera angles, action sequences, costumes, special effects, props, dialogues, ideas,... it's a myriad of inspirations.

324,harisankar ramaswamy,a year ago,"I dont know how the taste of the audience is going. Even if you like an action film, there has to be some motivation behind it. Vikram is very poorly written. May be that is why lokesh packed in stars. 
If people want such shallow movies then what can be said. 
I liked kgf 2. It is not mindless action. Kgf 2 had a strong screenplay and dialogues. Vikram has a very weak screenplay. 
If there is a sequel, i hope the makers take their time and build a strong screenplay and dialogues."," Rated 1.0 out of 5, "
