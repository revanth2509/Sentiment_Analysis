“And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten” Joel 2:25

Yes those wasted years over which we sigh shall be restored to us. God can give us such plentiful grace that we shall crowd into the remainder of our days as much of service as will be some recompense for those years of unregeneracy over which we mourn in humble penitence.

The locusts of backsliding, worldliness, lukewarmness, are now viewed by us as a terrible plague. Oh that they had never come near us! The Lord in mercy has now taken them away, and we are full of zeal to serve Him.

Blessed be His name, we can raise such harvests of spiritual graces as shall make our former barrenness to disappear. Through rich grace we can turn to account our bitter experience, and use it to warn others. We can become the more rooted in humility, childlike dependence, and penitent spirituality, by reason of our former shortcomings.

If we are the more watchful, zealous, and tender, we shall gain by our lamentable losses. The wasted years, by a miracle of love, can be restored. Does it seem too great a boon? Let us believe for it, and live for it, and we may yet realize it, even as Peter became all the more useful a man after his presumption was cured by his discovered weakness. Lord, aid us by thy grace.

""నేను పంపిన మిడతలును గొంగళి పరుగులును పసరు పరుగులును చీడ పురుగులును అను నా మహా సైన్యము తినివేసిన సంవత్సరముల పంటను మీకు మరలనిత్తును. "" యోవేలు 2:25

నిజమే. మన కష్టం అంతా వృధా అయిపోయిందని నిట్టూర్పులు విడిచిన ఆ సంవత్సరాల పంట అంతా మళ్ళీ మనకు అనుగ్రహించబడుతుంది. దేవుడు మనకు విస్తారమైన కృప ఇవ్వగలడు. గడచిన సంవత్సరాలలో ఏ విధమైన అభివృద్ధి లేకుండా కాలమంతా వ్యర్ధం అయిపోయిందని మనం దుఃఖపడి ఏడ్చాం. సహనంతో దీనంగా కనిపెట్టుకున్నాం. ఇప్పడు దేవుడు ఆ నష్టాన్నంతటినీ పూడ్చి తన దీవెనలతో నింపుతున్నాడు. కాబట్టి ఇంకా మన జీవితంలో మిగిలి ఉన్న సంవత్సరాల్లో మనం చేయగలిగినంత పరిచర్య చేద్దాం.

విశ్వాసంనుండి దిగజారిపోవడం, లోకాశలలో కూరుకుపోవడం, క్రైస్తవ జీవితంలో నులివెచ్చనితనం ఇలాంటి మిడతలను ఇప్పడు మనం భయంకరమైన తెగులుగా గుర్తించాం. మళ్ళీ అవి మన జీవితంలో ప్రవేశించకుండును గాక! మన దేవుడు తన మహా కృపచేత వాటిని మన జీవితం నుండి తొలగించేసాడు. ఇప్పడు మనం ఆయనను సంపూర్ణమైన ఆసక్తితో సేవిస్తున్నాం.

ఆయన నామం స్తుతించబడును గాక! ఇంతకుముందు మనకు కలిగిన శూన్యత అంతా మటుమాయం అయిపోయేటట్లు మనం ఇప్పడు గొప్ప ఆత్మీయ కృపల పంటను పండిద్దాం. ఆ అధికమైన కృప ద్వారా ఇతరులకు మన శ్రమానుభవాలను చెప్పి హెచ్చరిద్దాం. మనం ఇంకా దీనత్వాన్ని నేర్చుకుందాం. దానిలో మన వేరులు లోతుగా పారేటట్లు చేద్దాం. చిన్నపిల్లల్లా దేవుని మీద ఆధారపడదాం. పశ్చాత్తాపంతో కూడిన ఆత్మీయత చూపిద్దాం.

మన పాత అపజయాల అనుభవాలలోనుండి పాఠాలు నేర్చు కుందాం. మనం ఇంకా మెలకువగా ఉండి, ఆసక్తి చూపిస్తూ, మృదువుగా నడుచుకుంటూ ఉంటే దేవుని కృపాసహాయంతో మన నష్టాలన్నిటినీ లాభాలుగా మార్చుకోగలం. పోగొట్టుకొనిన సంవత్సరాల పంటనంతటినీ ఆశ్చర్యకరమైన దేవుని ప్రేమ ద్వారా తిరిగి పొందుతాం. అది గొప్ప సహాయంగా అనిపించడం లేదా? మనం దానికోసం జీవిద్దాం. తన బలహీనతలను గుర్తెరిగి, తనలో ఉన్న దురుసుతనాన్ని విడిచిపెట్టిన తర్వాత పేతురు ఎంతో ప్రయోజనకరమైన శిష్యుడయ్యాడు. ఇది మనం గ్రహించాలి."

874,anniexavier3709,1 year ago,"such a graceful,elegant energetic and charming performance by Kamal sir"
875,shakthivel5607,1 year ago (edited),"Well! Everyone is praising Kamal sir for this amazing performance
. But i can feel the real pain when he shot for this song, he said that he has rod on his leg but still danced to satisfy director and choreographer expectation. 

Lokesh sir said that before the song shoot his leg was like a beetroot. But still danced forgetting his pain. 

A true legend and his passion for cinema is unremarkable. 

We are proud to have a person like this."
