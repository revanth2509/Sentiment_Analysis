I realised one thing in this movie that the  groupism of kamal Sir's total unit of agent's (as a team) is relevant to Rajni sir's Badshah. Even he had a gang of 4 or 5 with some past experiences shown in the film.  It's Just a similarity else the story line up it's on a 2 different end. Just my views."

Kamal, sir, everyone knows he is the king ofthe Tamill film industry.  And  soorya vijaya fahad.   But kgf 95% actors are new. No experience.  So we should appreciate prashanth neel for make a masterpiece film with non experienced actor. About the story. Both stories are masterpiece  and acting also... waiting for vikram2 part.
Dont see it language and state viwe. See it from acting and making of film. Then you will get my point."
