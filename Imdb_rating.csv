This film will not disappoint you. What a comeback from Kamal.It's a sequel from 2019 Kaithi, every character was detailed properly.It's definitely not like Master! It's a Marana Lokesh padam.Vera level work by ANIRUDH!Family audience should realise this is the new commercial entertainer.The type of emotional mass masala movies should be dead! It's 2022 not 2005!Overall: a treat for cinema fans! 9/10This is the pride of Tamil cinema after multiple failures by big actors! (Not gonna mention who)

RECOMMENDEDKamal's most action packed film delivered without any lag from beginning to end. Even though we have bunch of stars in the cast, Vikram shines out everyone, at the same time everyone's space is kept well...
Movie has lot of Easter eggs from the beginning to end. Lot of reference to Lokesh and Kamal movie references.The movie is surprise sequel to ""kaithi"".Lokesh compromised little bit in master, here its full and full Lokesh show with mass moments. First half Kamal is there in very few scenes only, but shown as much as possible shades of him. The first half belongs to Fahad and VS. The interval block with Vikram BGM ending is ultimate. The first half is kind of perfect version of ""valimai"".Second half is filed with action sequences. The Milk fight scene and climax Kaithi fights are top notch. Movie has more gore and violent graphics...Lokesh handled the second half brilliantly and balanced with all cast perfectly. Very big Kudos to Lokesh... Climax Surya's cameo and Other surprises are claps worthy....
Must watch for everyone and Repeat watch for Kamal/movie fans.Getting ready for the next show.

The buildup and marketing to Lokesh Kanagaraj's Kamal Hassan starrer ""Vikram"" has been nothing short of all-encompassing, driven primarily by the fact that the 36-year old young director is yet to direct a sub-par movie, with ""Maanagaram (2017)"", ""Kaithi (2019)"" and ""Master (2021)"", all having been well-received by audiences. And the precocious storyteller delivers, with a mazy yet continuously engaging crime saga with resounding mass elevation sequences and enough emotional hooks to keep the audience invested.3-time National Award winner for Best Actor Kamal Hassan stars as a grieving father heartbroken at the loss of his son, who was a policeman investigating the burgeoning drug mafia in Chennai and who had, before his mysterious murder, uncovered a staggering cache of illegal drugs the syndicate safeguarded . Enter Fahadh Faasil, a black ops specialist charged with unraveling the mystery around the carnage unleashed by the cartel as a result. Vijay Sethupathi stars as the head honcho of the vicious and vengeful mafia operation and is first shown to the audience in one of the most intricately weaved, deliciously bonkers intro sequences for an antagonist in recent memory.It is testament to Lokesh Kanagaraj's directorial genius that he manages to give his three lead actors enough room to develop their characters and build a connect with the viewers. If it is Sethupathi's quirky eccentricities that catch the eye, Fahadh's intensity weaves a subplot of its own while Kamal excels in the emotional sequences. Lokesh Kanagaraj had told us to rewatch his classic ""Kaithi (2019)"" before we went to theaters to watch ""Vikram"" and with good reason, with the two movies being intricately connected and seemingly leading up to an extensive LKU-A mouth-watering Lokesh Kanagaraj Universe! A fantastic cameo from superstar Suriya is the cherry on the cake, with the actor looking the most stylish and massy he has in years!The director's penchant for crime thrillers, retro music and biryani continues to hold good for ""Vikram"" with Anirudh Ravichander's music rendering a soaring sheen to the narrative being built. The callbacks and references to old Kamal classics blend smoothly with the storytelling and are never jarring or contrived. The actor's phenomenal voice modulation and expressive eyes elevate even simple sequences to another level, especially his interactions with his toddler grandson.Master stunt choreographer duo Anbariv continue the same rich vein of form they displayed in the KGF franchise, but this time sacrificing the larger canvas for more close-quarters, hand-to-hand combat in tight spaces. Girish Gangadharan's cinematographer is other-worldly as usual, soaking up the bone-crunching action in all its glory. Editor Philomin Raj also deserves praise for ensuring that a movie with a seemingly daunting 3 hour run-time is never boring at any stretch.While you might see many of the plot's twists coming, the visual grammar, treatment and picturization takes your breath away, nevertheless. ""Vikram"" is yet another endeavor from a superstar fanboy that pays rich dividends, along the lines of Prithviraj's Mohanlal tribute ""Lucifer (2019)"", Karthik Subbaraj's Rajnikanth-starrer ""Pettah (2019)"" as well as Amal Neerad's ode to Mammootty, ""Bheeshma Parvam (2022)"". Highly recommended! Long live the Lokesh Kanagaraj universe!

Call it a magnum opus, or larger than life, but Vikram has been worth the wait. A Kamal Haasan film always brings innovation with it, and Vikram aces it in action. Mounted on superlative production values and a breathtaking pace, Vikram doesn't have one dull moment in its 146 minutes of running timeThe film starts with a series of murders, including that of Karan (Kamal Haasan) perpetrated by a team of vigilantes that claims to be cleaning up the system by waging a war against the system. Two of the three people murdered were policemen who had captured a large consignment of drugs and hidden the same in an unknown place, and Karan was the foster father of one of them. This is just the beginning. The Chennai Police Commissioner calls upon a crack team of sleuths led by Amar (Fahadh Faasil) to trace down the culprits as they are the best in the business. Amar and team go about systematically and conclude the case with a warning to the Commissioner himself - that Amar knew who murdered one of the two policemen, and that Vikram, the original leader of the Black Squad from the 1980s, taken for dead, is back to life and out on a mission to rid the nation of the drug menace.Vikram (Kamal Haasan) is in reality an undercover agent leading a team of vigilantes, cleaning up drug mercenaries knowing very well that their current crop of antagonists headed by a local drug lord Chandhan (Vijay Sethupati) are just small fish that must be dealt with. The real big fish Rolex is who their ultimate aim is.Vikram, helmed by Lokesh Kanagaraj is visually spectacular. A taut action adventure, it extracts Kamal Haasan to his fullest potential, but doesn't showcase him in every frame to make sufficient space for Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupati too. In fact, the three men are the core of Vikram, in very different roles that make the movie immensely watchable with a mix of myriad emotions and action at its best. The climax is violent, with the use of an arsenal of firearms and hand to hand combat, setting up a finger licking wait for the potential sequel where Vikram will lock horns with Rolex (Suriya, playing a surprise cameo). Don't wait for Vikram to drop into OTT platforms, for a film like this must only be watched in the theatres.

Lokesh Kanagaraj's idea to make an universe out of his films expands with Vikram. The movie begins where Kaithi ends. Two containers full of costly drugs go missing. The local Pablo Escobar, Santhanam (Vijay) is hell bent on finding it. Amid this is a group of masked killers killing people who have something in common. The police hire a shadow gang to find them out and the drama unfolds.There is style, unimaginable action sequences, Thrill , suspense and all of this performed by some of the most talented actors Indian houses right now. Fafa gets to play the most interesting part as he transforms with the movie. There is a journey to his submission to the lawless justice and when you have an actor of Faasil's calibre it only becomes hauntingly beautiful. Kamal Haasan makes a comeback after a long time and he is superb in his action avatar. Vijay's facial expressions, body language, and screen presence Was good.Postive Points -PerformancesAnirudh's BGMStorytellingEntertainmentNegative Points -the writing is slightly generic in a lot of placespredictable first Half , even a kid could tell that the person behind the mask is Kamal and he was alive.

The greatest challenge for Lokesh Kanagaraj, as a filmmaker, wasn't just to offer several hoot-worthy moments for fans of Kamal Hassan, but to come up with a first-of-its-kind pure action film featuring a trio of actors who are known for their spectacular performances. His packaging totally delivers, with a fantastic outing for all the guys involved. Plotwise speaking, Vikram is basically The Batman set in Chennai. A serial killer is on the loose, and a special ops team is tasked with finding the culprit. While that's just one way of putting it across, Vikram is a lot beyond that. It's also about a father avenging his son's death, and a massive drug bust; it's also about gangsters, special agents, and rogue cops - Lokesh's universe-building skills are excellent!I'm SO GLAD Lokesh chose these actors to play their respective roles. Vijay Sethupathi's antagonist act is even more menacing than the one in Master, and when he's high, he's next-level. Fahadh Faasil essentially holds the proceedings together in the first half, in a solid feat that keeps getting better. As for Hassan, this is a film where the director just lets him run amok, going absolutely wild in the set-pieces. Speaking of the set-pieces (choreographed by Anbariv), these are some of the most well-crafted and staged works you'll see in an Indian film in a good while. DOP Girish Gangadharan captures all the pyro-filled beauty of the action, while also using close-ups to pick up the subtler expressions of the dashing trio.And there is no Vikram without Anirudh Ravichander, whose remarkable music and background score elevate the film to greater heights. The riff-filled theme music is one that'll stay on my playlist for a pretty long time. The editing by Philomin Raj ensures a certain pace to the film's events, even when it shows signs of slowing down. Suriya's late entry sparks even more delight when he's playing a full-blown baddie, with chances of him squaring off against Dilli (from Kaithi) all the more possible now. Yes, (re)watch Kaithi before seeing Vikram for an enhanced universe-building experience.

Lokesh is one of my favorite director and my favorite film of him is Master, it was Awesome combination of storytelling, emotions and Fan service of Vijay.Here, I guess Lokesh was trying to live his childhood dream and encorporated everything he loves in a single movie and tried to make it the greatest movie of all time but he only succeeded partially. As a Refrence I would like to say 'he was trying to make a Guy Ritchie film with a SS Rajamouli film with a Michael Bay film with with a Quentin Tarantino film' all four in one along with full tribute and Fan service to kamal hasan & full utilisation of Fahadh Faasil. In the process he went into overkill mode & as a result the film visually looks Awesome with some great mass moments but that's about it, you take nothing home with you. You don't care about the story or the characters much, you just wait for the next mass moment and action scene. Also in trying to tick so many boxes he wasted awesome Vijay Sethupathi ,who was phenomenal in Master but he had nothing much to do in this film, he was just a generic villian whose only role was to growl looking at the camera.Now I am going to talk a bit about SPOILERS for those who have seen the movie, and for those who haven'tSPOILER ALERTEveryone's Excited about Surya's cameo, his character was build up like he was the boss of all bosses; but I didn't feel one bit intimidated or intrigued by his presence.Instead of the star presence and the gravity that he has there was nothing new or exciting about his character, he was shouting, trying to be menacing and unpredictable but his role just went flat for me. It didn't kept me hooked or Excited on how he would produce a great challenge and antagonist to Kamal Hasan's character in the next part, it just looked like Surya was trying to play a drug addict mob boss villian.All in all it's a decent watch for Kamal Hasan, Fahadh Faasil some action sequences and mass moments but nothing more than that.

All I could hear for the past few days is that Vikram is such an awesome movie and all. So naturally, I had so much expectations. I have to say I wasn't satisfied. But I wasn't disappointed either.The action sequences are well shot. Kamal, Fahad, Chemban Vinod(the police officer) nailed their roles. Anirudh does a great job with the background score and songs.Keep your expectations low and you'll be in for a treat.

","<span class=""review-date"">4 June 2022</span>","
Vikram is one of the most interesting and anticipating movie for everyone because of the massive star cast. After Pushpa, RRR and KGF Chapter 2, Vikram is released to roar. The film is a complete commercial paisa wasool movie.First half of the movie is fantastic. Fahadh Faasil is the best young actor in today's time according to me. He has done a superb job. Vijay Setupathy is a gem of an actor. I loved his entry scene here. No other actor can pull up this entry scene as he has done it. Other star cast is also very much suitable and provide a good support. First half belongs to FaFa and Vijay.While, the second half is a treat for Kamal Haasan fans. Ulaga Nayagan- Kamal Haasan is extremely good in the post interval portion. You will be surprised to see him firing constantly from the giant machine gun. That scene is on another level.Though, one may find first half awesome and second half a bit stretched. I found that there are some surprises in the later half, but there are a few blunders too. But just a few. Like I didn't get the scene of child re-breathing.Special mention to the actress who played the role of a maid. She is superb.Lokesh's direction is improving gradually. This film will be considered his finest directorial product. He has done a fine job, without getting caught by the idea of too much slow-motion, which many people hate including me, and which were too much in KGF. Though, this film is different from RRR and KGF, it can be compared with Pushpa. As part 2 is coming here too. People are going to love Surya as the bad guy in part two. Just a glimpse of him in the end was terrific.Anirudhha has done his job superbly once again. The title theme music is on my mind while I'm writing this. Extraordinary music with a catchy tune is what Anirudhha offers to you!On the whole, a must watch movie in theaters. This is how a good commercial south indian movie looks like. A good movie with stellar performances.

17,OnjiMooteDaMarle," When the actor becomes bigger than the story, the story loses it's life
","<span class=""review-date"">9 July 2022</span>","
Apart from a brilliant Sethupathi & an above average Fahadh, there is nothing in this film that makes it worth spending nearly 3 hours let alone any money. There is drugs & gangsters with politicians. Then there is a suspense that is so diluted that you know it from the very beginning what it is because of the casting. When the actor become bigger than the story, the story loses it's value, shine & life. The director tried to make it a show with unnecessary style but it is played so many times in films. The story is bland and has nothing new to offer not even any moments to remember. The VFX is below par even for a Tamil film. The music & the lyrics are worse than the screenplay. The teaser that was shown of the film was a show. Nothing in the film resonated with the teaser. The teaser was excellent with Kamal getting ready to feed a lot of big shots probably gangsters at the same time gets ready with guns and ammunitions. So the teaser was a fluke.Why does Kamal Hassan's face look so much filled with VFX or make up? It looked bad in the trailer itself. Make him look his real self! I am in awe of Vijay Sethupathi's expressions. His first I watched was Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom. While actors go for 6 pack and body transformations to show off themselves (and not their acting skills) Sethupathi's physique has never come in between his class acting. Sethu should stop taking such films. He's already done Vikram Vedha & Master with similar roles. Fahad is a brilliant actor as well but he is so good in dramas more than such action films especially Malayalam dramas.Aniruddh's music has always been more of a copy of what has been already heard be it using Ilayaraja's old music for his 'famous' Why this kolaveri d or be it here the lullaby that has so much resemblance to the opening credit song from Nayakan - Thenpandi Cheemayile. The music is a huge dud. I hate the way films say 'an aniruddh musical'. That's what you say about Ilayaraja or A. R. Rahman. This boy hasn't come out with any music that has transcended boundaries and with the kind of music he produces, I doubt he ever will.If they are going for a sequel, hope they write better. Finally Welcome Suriya!

Second half completely filled with action sequence and Aandavar's swag . Vijay Sethupathi as antagonist was completely different from his usual way of performance , it could've been more better if they had explored bit more of "" Santhanam "" character . Fahadh Faasil plays as investigative officer , as expected he steals the show , first half completely dominated by Fafa . Kamal as Vikram , right from pre interval to end showed comeplete swag , eventhough in first half he had less screentime he scored in some emotional parts . Asusual Anirudh music was back bone of te movie . Cinematography was jus stunning , especially in pre interval camera movements was just awesome ( they used high techs ) .

Filmmaker Lokesh Kanagaraj uses the talent of actors Fahadh Faasil, Vijay Sethupathi and Kamal Haasan brilliantly in his latest venture Vikram.Vikram is a befitting comeback of Kamal Haasan to satiate his fans' 4-year-long hunger to see him on the big screen. The title Vikram is borrowed from the actor's own film which released in 1986. However, the story is set in director Lokesh Kanagaraj's cinematic universe wherein he has interlinked characters from his previous directorial Kaithi and the old Vikram. The music of the film is composed by Anirudh Ravichander and the dialogues are written by Rathna Kumar along with the director.Lokesh Kanagaraj has loaded Vikram with a battalion of characters but he has ensured that all of them have their due scope to perform, even though some might have lesser screen time including 'Ulaga Naayagan'.This simply shows his prowess as a writer who values his story over simply paying the fanboy tributes to his guru Kamal Haasan for the sake of it. But that doesn't mean there is a dearth of mass moments for his favorite star. Every time Kamal makes his entry, the background music with Anirudh's voice - 'Once upon a time, there lived a ghost' - feels electrifying, quite literally.Vikram truly comes alive post the adrenaline-filled interval scene. Action is Lokesh's forte and the second-half has impressive stunts (stunt directors are Anbariv masters) and a superior camera work by Girish Gangadharan.Watching Kamal Haasan, who is apparently 67 years old but certainly doesn't look that way on screen in this all new action avatar takes one back in time to the early days of the actor's career - younger and dapper.The film is in a way an ode to the veteran actor with umpteen number of references from his older films like Kuruthipunal, Panchatanthiram, and Nayakan. Dark humour to detailing, all departments of Vikram have worked in unison to render a massive salute to the exemplary filmography of the legendary Kamal Haasan.On the other hand, Vijay Sethupathi is remarkable as Santhanam especially in his whistle worthy and quirky introduction scene. Though it was refreshing to see him try out something new shedding off his usual Sethupathi-ness, his tight-lipped dialogue delivery instead of coming across as an interesting characterization was only a major distraction.However, Fahadh Faasil steals the show with an all round performance exhibiting passion, love and revenge at perfect levels.Kamal Haasan is, as has been emphasized already, fabulous. Vijay Sethupathi fleshes out an edgy criminal whose frazzled heart and addled mind push him in startling directions. Fahadh Faasil sails through his role with such aplomb that one can never have enough of him. How tantalizing is the prospect that the consummate show-stealer will be back to reprise the role - repeatedly hopefully - as the Lokesh Kanagaraj universe expands and moves into the future!

This was literally out of imagination. We can say that this was one steps further to KGF -2.I don't know where South Indian Industries are going, but the way they move, it's going to be tough for KOREAN FILM INDUSTRY & HOLLYWOOD INDUSTRY.This is the must-watch movie to feel the theater experience.

I'll admit it- i loved the original Vikram movie (1986) which was a spy thriller and ahead of its time in Indian cinema. Not surprisingly, I had similar expectations for this movie as I walked in.Lo and behold, I was hit with a badly done knockoff copy of reservoir dogs/pulp fiction/KGF coupled with crass dialogues, cuss words and poor character development (apart from Kamal's character). This turned out to be a typical mass masala movie involving gangsters, corrupt police officials whom the hero literally mows down using a WW-I era machine gun. I wish I could get back those 3 hours of my life, my money and my dead brain cells.Needless to say, this is going to be my last kamal movie. If you're a die-hard kamal fan who doesn't care about others think and wants to kill some time watching this in a theater, go for it.

Storyline - Agent Vikram (Kamal) with his masked identity leads a masked gang, who have their own tragic story in their past because of a dreadly drug mafia. Agent Vikram fights against the drug mafia, headed by Santhanam (Vijay Sethupathi) with the help of an undercover agent Amar (Fahad Fasil) and Bejoy (Narein). How does he successfully defeat the gang of Santhanam, forms the rest of the story.Performance wise, Kamal and Fahad Fasil have done their part good. If first half of the film is dominated by Fahad Fasil, second half of the film is dominated by Kamal Hassan. Vijay Sethupathi's villain role could have been better as comparing his role in ""Master"", the villain role in this film seems to be weak.The film has surprise cameo roles connected with director's previous films. The film has got good production values but screenplay of the film is simple and many twists are quite predictable.Direction wise, the film is not as good as edge of the seat thriller ""Kaithi"" nor it is not as bad as ""Master"". The film is an average commercial flick with good action block.

Wow! This is one of the best action films ever made in the world cinema. The brilliant direction and cinematography makes it very interesting. Brilliant performance from Kamal sir and it's the best comeback. All the performances from the rest of the crew is great to watch.The soundtrack from Anirudh sir is stunning and makes it completely engaging. Surya sir role atlast is magical and completely unexpected and brilliantly shot. This film has few references to Kaithi film, hence learning some main characters in Kaithi will help you in understanding some scenes better in this film.

","<span class=""review-date"">3 June 2022</span>","
As much as I enjoyed this movie, I still feel like this shouldn't have been a Kamal Haasan movie.Kamal has had a string of great movies recently... With Unnaipol Oruvan; a dialogue-heavy movie where the conflict required no excessiveness, with Vishwaroopam; a movie while flawed, was ambitious enough to take Tamil cinema to a non-Tamil accustomed front, with Uttama Villain; one of Kamal Haasan's best movies to date that is one of the very few movies in this exaggerated industry to consciously portray cinema as an actual art form, with Papanasam; one of the most simplest, yet a brilliantly made thrillers, with Thoongavanam; a movie that seemed to rid itself of every cliche that plagues the Tamil cinema industry (this includes the runtime as well), and Vishwaroopam 2; well.... Vishwaroopam 2 never happened.And after 4 years, we have a new Kamal Haasan movie; which while enjoyable by Tamil cinema standards, doesn't have the ambitions and the cinematic progressiveness that Kamal movies have had. It was very well written, especially in its first half, but ultimately ends up being a Tamil action movie and I need not asterisk anything. The energy of the movie never waned and while it did seem like the writers hyped the story into a cliche third act, the movie holds up well, very well in fact, in the entertainment box.Overall, I'd rather have seen this movie with some other actor since I feel like this macho persona is best left for someone that is not Kamal Haasan... not that he's bad at it, he actually did a stellar job, but because as of right now, he's the only big name Tamil actor to push the boundaries of this cursed industry. The last thing I'd want from him is the usual Tamil archetype overpowered Super Saiyan freak that we've seen a million times.

##First day, First show in Fun Mall.There comes several Pan-Indian movies in 2022- Kgf 2, RRR, etc. But, this movie is something special. After KGF: Chapter 2, it was Vikram, which I loved a lot. Be it the cast performance, cinematography, editing and direction, everything was picture-perfect and top-notchüëçüèªüëèüèªüëåüèΩüëåüèΩThere were lots and lots of Wowww moments in the film. In the first half, Actor Fahadh Fasil sir completely steals the show through his macho body and eyes. Vijay Sethupathi too steals the show as menacing villain. He made me to hate his character. Such a splendid performance.Second Half- Completely belongs to our Aandavar! None other than our great Kamal Hassan ayya. Our Ulaga Nayakan sir! Lots of goosebumps and firy momentsüî•üî•üî•The song Naayakan meendum varaan was really a worth. It's a mass comeback of our great Ulaganayakan. Pathala Pathala gave me vibes.The way Lokesh sir links the scenes with Kaithi was massy and superb. Supporting actors- Narain sir, Arjun Das sir, Harish Uthaman sir and the rest had limited screen to share. However, they left an impact through their intensity. I felt there is some connection between Kaithi and this film. Let's wait and watch. In the end, Suriya sir's cameo appearence is another big highlight. Everyone must watch his scene.So, coming to the direction, I loved Lokesh sir's way of linking the plot. After Kaithi, this was the film, I loved the most along with his Master and Maanagaram. Lots of twists and turns are there in the film.Music and BGM by Anirudh Anna was awesomeüëåüèΩüëèüèªAnd coming to the stunt sequences by Anbariv Anna. They have given lots of soul and efforts to this film. Especially the gun scene in the climax. It was more goosebumps than KGF: Chapter 2, where the same was shot. Enna, anga Periyappa! Inga namma Vikram sir! Avlo thaan. But, marana mass scene. The film have inspired me to work on different stories in the storymirror alongside KGF: 2 and Tenet.My rating: 5/5üëåüèΩüí•Worth a watch nanbargale. As I said, ""Sirapaana tharamaana sambavam irukku."" Kollywood would go to the Pan-India level with the help of our Ulaga Nayakan ayya and this is an inspiration for me as an aspiring and upcoming film director of Kollywood. If KGF: Chapter 2 inspired me to work on gangster genres and create a similar universe of those, Vikram is in top-notch. It had inspired me to think to next level of developing and thinking spy stories. A new path for innovative screenplays. Thank you Lokesh sir! Thank you so much for giving us a memorable film. Keep making films like this!üòòüí•üí•

","<span class=""review-date"">26 June 2022</span>","
This is probably the first-ever spin-off kinda film that too with so many top actors playing in it and luckily it has also worked very well.The plot isn't so intriguing but the screenplay and twists & turns of so many characters all over the film are something that has worked really well, especially the Agent Tina character came as a huge surprise and the linkage of Kaithi as the film happening in the same timeline is something that keeps us hooked and finally the Surya character although being so shuttle, it gives a very good lead for the sequel.Another spin-off like this could be the journey of the Rayappan character from Bigil, this probably might take Vijay's status to some other level but only time will tell if it'd happen at all.Irumugan/Lucy kinda drug sequences with Vijay Sethupathi aren't so attractive to have in the film unless they got portrayed by him so differently starting from the introduction of auto balti action sequence.And most importantly, the possibility of having so many spin-offs with marvels like Loki-universe(LCU) is something that could take this Tamil cinema to a wholly different level. This is supposedly the start of Tamil cinema's upward journey.Kamal is the only top actor who's comfortable in sharing screen space with co-actors in the industry to a greater extent which is why this film has paid him off so handsomely after a very very long time, its good to see that his ambitions would grow further in delivering a quality film that takes up the industry standards.And not to mention, the real hero of the film is Anirudh, the BGM and the soundtracks are nothing but just his best and totally exceptional ones, this is probably the rock star's best, IMAO.

Such an outstanding mass movie from Tamil cinema industry after very long time. Actually the story was well written to celebrate Kamal Hassan. Well, yes indeed, the director has succeeded in executing that. But still the screenplay, making, action choreography and bgm could have been original. So that we could have said it was a movie with international standards. Still this one is surely a feast for mass movie audience and Kamal Hassan fans ofcourse. Talking about Kamal Hassan, he was the pinnacle of new age cinema. Age is just numbers for that guy. Watch it in theatres along full crowd. It is VERA LEVEL experience.

Loki redeems kollywood with comprehendible script and furious screenplay. It takes lot of courage to kill
the protagonist in the second scene of the movie. Except for an overdose of ultra violence with deafening ammunition sounds, the movie has everything for an action film enthusiast. Primarily, all
the principal actors added golden feathers to the already decorated character sketch, they portrayed.Kamal's sentiment as a grandfather could jerk a tear, VJS evil-grin is horrific (award deserving) and
Fahad's acting puts you spellbound. References of Dilli (from Kaithi movie), adaikalam (from Vikram -
1986), highway scene (from managram) makes it first Indian movie to have multiverse (as in Avengers).Anirudh's score makes your adrenaline gushing down the spine in ecstasy. The film features few cameos that gift us with lots of surprising action sequences. And don't miss the pre-interval block, the
camera-man elates you to a hyper-lane.

Stunning Screenplay. Given Equal Importance to all those characters. No words to say about Kamal Hassan, Vijay Sethupathi, Faradh Fasil.. they have done Monster Class Performance. Others too equally shown their performance. Technically Very Strong and Powerful. Cinematography, Music, Stunt, Editing, Lighting, Artwork etc.. - Very Great Work. Standing Ovation to the entire team of Vikram. Definitely Biggest Blockbuster with Box Office Collection in Indian Cinema for this year. Movie will receive repeated audience.

People were a *plenty.**N* arcotics mafia gang movies have a common theme, gory ways of killing people. Intelligent ways of escaping, and the good guys finish up winning after many bruises. My original feeling was it is yet another Narcos extension. My feeling got crushed, when the movie starts with a search. A search to demystify an undercover agent. Amar(Fahad Fazil) the good cop tries to demystify the undercover a serial killing pattern, but realises it is a much bigger and a sinister plan behind it. He realises the serial killing spree was triggered by the capture of a Raw Narcotic *bounty*.*D* etermined to demystify, he travels to a great extent and finds out the various facets of Karnan (Kamal), who is actually is a victim of the serial killing. And that way we miss Kamal most of the first half of the movie. Amar's path crosses with Sandhanam (Vijay sethupathy) a quack, meth cook and a terrible gangster. The entry of Sandhanam is not from a glittering higher end automobile, but from a normal rickety auto rickshaw. The entry was really different, bear and very intriguing. Sandhanam's trade mark teeth line and his lip position to reveal it adds to the gory face lift. Every inch of his body and the every move of his will give you a characteristic of a thug on the move to regain his *booty.**A* nriudh's score beats all normalcy. It's the score and the power of the star cast that will let you live the movie through out. Karnan is revealed like a flickering lamp, which flickers after a long interval and over time flickers faster till it glitters brightly. The goose bump moment of the movie feels real. Even in that high octane pace of the movie, the audience clapping and whistling could not be missed. Though one can easily mark the behaviour of the audience as a first day first show mania, I sensed more *novelty.**V* ersatility at its best, is what I would sum up Kamal's performance with. No matter, whom you bring in, be it Amar, Sandhanam or Rolex (Surya), Vikram makes the entire cast look like an adorable puppy. No one can ignore an adorable puppy but one has to feel the ghost through out. Keep aside the ideologies and political inclinations, as a thespian Kamal outclasses every one in the movie. A great treat from Kamal after a long hiatus. Trust me the septuagenerian can shake a leg with a lot of ease, and he can put us all in shame. No exaggeration or a sublime performance, it was *brevity.**A* uthentic screenplay and script. Lokesh Kanakaraj does in best but stitching parts from his earlier blockbusters into this one. You will see scenes from Kaidhi snuggly nestled into this movie. The first half leaves a lot of moving parts in your mind and in the second half you will see that all those parts falling in place seamlessly. Thats the beauty of closing the loop efficiently. A lot of action in the movie, but I never felt anything superfluous, I felt it was all adding up. The introduction of the first batch of the special task force was pulsating. The revealing of the lady agent was simply outstanding, look forward for it. The metaphor used to rescue the next generation was very interesting, follow the path of the kid in the movie and you will realise what I mean by it. In the end all the twists will deliver a lot of *Clarity.**R* apid action scenes packed by Lokesh, wonderful background score of Anirudh, smart use of ageing weapons, expressive eyes of Fahad Fazil, Glittering teeth of Vijay Sethupathi and relentless performance of Kamal will give you all a wholesome treat. Oops! I forgot to remind you all the age of the Ulaganayagan. He is young at *Seventy*4.5/5 for the movie. A score of an infinity for Kamal. I just got my tickets booked for a repeat viewing on Sunday, and I am sure you will do many repeats.

What a shame to see how reviews are made or bought... Scrip writing... Impractical and bad, action sequences are such as if godly persons are acting in a drama which is action packed, these sequences are hard to believe to be real. Explanation of killing the members of the elite gang was just best joke of the movie. 8.4 imdb rating for such a movie... Really unbelievable.. I will rate it under 5.

","<span class=""review-date"">8 June 2022</span>","
VIKRAM had a fairly good story but it was totally buried by mindless action and totally illogical sequences. Kamal Hassan at 67 years old was indulging in action sequences with such vigour,energy and supreme strength as if he were in his 20s-to early 40s! After receiving such heavy beatings he miraculously recovered relatively unscathed to beat the villain almost to a pulp. Although he is an outstanding actor his role in this movie did not require him to display his acting prowess,but just indulge in endless and mindless action sequences and pretending to be drunk. With the exception of Amar who was quite competent, and the maid who was brilliant in her action scenes,the acting was extremely bad with Chandan being particularly useless. All in all this was a film that was made for the masses with the tagline""LEAVE YOUR BRAINS AT HOME""

","<span class=""review-date"">6 June 2022</span>","
Worst movie i have watched till date this year. No plot, no good story, total nonsense.One hero is there, 20-30 villains are coming. He is easily beating the hell out of them. Same for co-actors. 20-30 villains are firing, not even a single bullet hits the hero while all the villians are dead. Places RDX inside a gangster's lab, while gangster didn't even realised that.. Talk about realism and story plot.. Do these directors really think Indian people are this dumb. If you are used to watching decent global crime detective thrillers, even some classic national/regional ones, then avoid this movie by all possible means. Total time waste.

I felt vikram like an average action film. I felt like losing continuity between the scenes. All the action were used in the second half. I felt lag in the pace. Personally i liked the vijay sethupathi's character. And his introduction scene was awesome. All the actors performance was good. But i felt some of gripping elements was missing from the movie. I should say it is a theatre experience for the sound effects and robotic camera scenes. The fight sequences were also nice.

58,naveensankaran18," An intense and ambitious execution that is more than ""just"" a fanboy commercial
","<span class=""review-date"">1 November 2022</span>","
With some of the greatest actors in the business, this directorial from the exceedingly talented Lokesh Kanagaraj has everything a Kamal movie has - an ambitious scale, plot-driven characters, strong technicality, and respect for the cinematic intellect of a commoner, and of course, the man himself!When a project of a mammoth scale is in development, a lot of things are at stake; there are numerous possibilities where it might not just work out. For such a project to make a victory leap, everything has to work properly, literally everything! It has to work big time and I am not just speaking about its commercial value, but its technicality, authenticity, and the culmination of every single person in the unit. Everything just has to work. And Vikram achieved every single one of these and much more than that!At first, I thought Vikram will be just another fanboy commercial, where the director might end up working ""too"" hard to make his beloved hero dance to his moves, resulting in a rather average product. However, Lokesh had other plans. And boy oh boy did he execute it in style!The ""Spin-off"" verse of Lokesh Kanagaraj - LCUThe term spin-offs, crossovers, and multiverse are not new to cinema-goers, especially the Marvel fans. However, unlike in Hollywood, it was pretty difficult to pull off something like that here in Indian Cinema. Though cameo roles by established actors are rather prevalent, it stayed mostly as an idea and did not take the next step ahead. Though there are exceptions in the horror-comedy genre, there wasn't a movie that is so true to its core plot and character development, until Lokesh came into the picture.In most of his earlier interviews, Lokesh never shied away from expressing his desire to make spinoffs and what-ifs with his favorite characters, especially Ulaganayagan's. The core concept of Kaidhi (Virumaandi) and even his last release Master (Nammavar) are great examples.So, when Kamal Haasan suggested something on the lines of his yesteryear espionage thriller (Vikram), Lokesh saw an opportunity and grabbed it like anything - the opportunity to expand his universe on a large scale, to make a multi-starrer that can lead to several other movies churning out in the future, to make it as a Lokesh Cinematic Universe.All of a sudden, everything became possible. It was possible to have a star like Suriya play an incredibly brief yet intense role in the film, it was possible to ask big actors like Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi to wait for a few more hours during the shoot, and it was possible to make a movie with one of the leading character not even appearing more than a few minutes in its entire first half! Everything seemed possible. Call it the recent OTT trend, call it the new wave but for me, the reason is the man himself - Kamal Haasan. He made it possible. He made everything possible, even though he is not there entirely, just like a GHOST!Kamal Haasan - The GhostWith a career spanning over 60 years, the impact this man-made on several individuals is purely limitless. So, whenever someone gets inspired by KH, it is as if the man is delivering himself. It takes pure guts from Lokesh to have one's beloved hero in such an introductory sequence, as the title appears. Even though KH is not there almost entirely in the first half, he is still there as a Ghost. No, I am not mentioning the narrative but the writing, in the technicality, in providing proper characterization, in providing moments for almost every character to relish on screen. As he said at an award function, it was as if he was directing the movie; he was Lokesh's ghost (Yes, it is an Interstellar reference).A 100% Lokesh Kanagaraj FilmAfter his 50% Vijay-50% Lokesh movie (Master), Lokesh promised a 100% Lokesh movie and he delivered! Right from the start, the narrative dove right into the plot. It did not deviate an inch, providing us an intense experience throughout. Every single aspect expressed on the screen is somehow a part of the narrative, which is surprising for me. To the core! I mean, even the supposedly ""Hero Introduction Song"" becomes part of the story after a while. I was expecting some emotional sequences like the ones in Kaidhi and thought Lokesh might not just succeed there but boy he surprised me there as well. Yes, there is an emotional bond between Vikram and the child but the child itself becomes part of the story and even an action-block!Learning from his mistakes of the past, Lokesh presented us with a narrative that stays true to its genre. Yes, it has romance, songs, stunt sequences, care, affection, and pain, but all of them are part of the narrative. Though seeming complex at first, the narrative opens itself slowly, offering us bread crumbs as we search through it, just as one of the characters mentions. Some might call it boring, complex, or simply a gimmick. I will call it respecting the cinematic intellect of the audience, a commoner.A Fanboy movieWhat does one expect in a fanboy movie? The celebration (and a tribute) to one particular person who is adored and worshipped by many. It should have elements that are extremely true to that person. For instance, Petta is a perfect example of a fanboy movie, where Karthik Subbaraj celebrated Rajinism like anything. Lokesh, who is an Aandavar fan (as they call him), incorporated everything a Kamal movie should have - ambitious scale, plot-driven characters, accepting that the audience is more intelligent, and having the right people with you, who share an equal love towards the same human.Often termed as an actor who speaks with his eyes, it was a great addition to have Fahadh Faasil in Vikram. He literally carried the entire first half on his shoulders, that is all about investigation and searching for bread crumbs. There is one sequence that involves him and a car driver, which was easily pulled off by the performer in Fahadh. Apart from being an extraordinary performer, he has been a constant admirer of the performer in KH. Even one of his latest releases - Malik - is a kind of ode to Nayakan and the performer in KH. Hence, I guess it was relatively easy for Lokesh to convince him to take the extra leap, for the sake of Ulaganayagan!Having already played one of the strongest antagonists ever, it was difficult for Vijay Sethupathi after Master to essay a demoniac role that has a similar intensity and yet looks different entirely. Though his role was overshadowed by other elements, his performance still stands apart from the rest, and there is something to take home, and this for me, is something good! This was a great space to make use of and Vjs utilized it to his benefit, sharing the screen space with some of the finest co-stars he could ever imagine.There is one more character I want to write about, scream about! Agent Tina! Though there were clues, I was completely taken aback by the character, and what a way to show perfect Indian espionage! Just wow! She is the Dancing Rose in this film! (Sarpatta Parambarai movie reference). But for the sake of people who are yet to watch the movie, I will keep my mouth shut, for the moment.!Though the cameo was extremely short, the gruesome nature exhibited by Suriya was something I was not prepared for. It was literally some ferocious, cold-hearted stuff from such a performer after a really long time! I am just hoping to catch on to more of his grey shades in near future. But, just for a moment, I thought, what if the Superstar himself has played the role. WHAT IF ?!The TechnicalityWith such an intense narration and most of it happening during the night, I could see the tiresome work from the entire technical crew members. With some great stunt sequences in its kitty, the twin duo of Anbariv choreographed the action scenes as close as possible to the reality, without over-the-top stunts. With great support from Girish Gangadharan (Cinematography) and Philomin Raj (Editor), the action part looked authentic and gripping enough for the audience and did not let them slip away from the narrative as well.The moment when a certain character steps out of a prostitute's room, Anirudh started playing his magic where I understood he is literally doing everything he can to make the score sound different! Be it the songs or the background score, Anirudh is still one of the major reasons why people are flocking to theatres in this OTT era.Special kudos to the ADs who were sincere enough to cover the logic loopholes as much as possible! Finally, CCTV footage looks exactly like CCTV footage!Final thoughtsOverall, it was purely a delight for cinephiles to witness the audience enjoy such a visual spectacle without many songs or hero appreciation! It's always the baby steps that matter and Lokesh took a giant leap with Vikram and I am happy that it is being received well by the audience and critics alike. I just wish this man stays for more mask-revealing years to come, and am eager to witness his growth all along!

The movie was a waste of time watching. Went in with too much expectations only to be disappointed by cliche tamil movie shortcomings. The villains all graduated from storm trooper school of shooting. The side characters were brushed aside for the kill count like it was a horror movie. Plot Armor always prevents Vikram (Kamal) from getting 1 shot by villains despite his abysmal stealth and defence. Kamal was probably undercover Hulk, can just one hit KO opponents with a single punch despite being a 60 year old grandpa. It was unrealistic to the core and the explosion/demolition CGI was worse than video games made in 2000s.The plot too was repetitive. Lokesh Kanagaraj already did Master with the similar plot of dealing with a drug dealer antagonist. It also casted some characters from this movie in it. Still Kanagaraj shamelessly claims that his movies are a part of a connected universe. How can a single universe have same people with different identities at the same time (like Sandhanam and Bhavani)? Vikram's fake Big Boss accent was infuriating to hear. People don't speak like a megatron in real life.Tl;Dr this movie was a tamil Michael Bay movie. It was a lot of explosions and no logic. Kamal Haasan once said ""Kathai ya araiya koodathu"". Now I understand why he said so. Because otherwise tamil movie industry won't be able to sell its movies.

Vikram (2022) :
Brief Review -Lokesh Kanagaraj creates a crazy universe of his own with a spiritual sequel to the 80s forgotten flick. Vikram promises more as a future franchise than the film itself. Lokesh Kangaraj's Vikram is a phenomenal idea for any cinematic universe, and surpasses many of the known universes, be it Bollywood or Hollywood. I won't take the names. No, wait, let's be clear. Whether it's Rohit Shetty's Cop Universe, YRF's Spy Universe, Marvel Cinematic Universe, or DC Extended Universe, script-wise, Vikram outperforms them all. But yes, the execution is a little faulty. The South-Driven mass elements are there to spoil its cinematic values, but those who have loved watching such films will have no issues. You have the cars flying, just like KGF 2. You have insane action like any typical south film (be it any film industry). It shows unnecessarily loud explosions on the wrong occasions, like in any outdated mass flick. Nevertheless, it still entertains you and keeps you hooked on the story. The biggest USP of the film is the assembling of three powerhouse performers. The living legend, Kamal Haasan, with two emerging legends, Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil, and everyone getting equally great roles and their own shining shades. Uff.. it can't get better in a crime saga. That extra boost of Rolex Sir and Kaithi creates an irresistible atmosphere, and you can't wait long enough for the next films in LCU. With a bit of edgy finishing and stable action, Vikram would have looked more classy, but it's okay. Lokesh is too young to deliver an extraordinary mass film yet. Except for that mediocre action flick, ""Master,"" he hasn't done anything below par. Maanagaram was a tricky film for any debutant, while Kaithi was easier and more mss-friendly. With Vikram, Lokesh manages to merge two genres and two different storytelling styles, and hopefully he will get better with his upcoming film. Fingers crossed.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.

There were so much of fan theories around when the trailer was released. Well thats probably it. The way he connected the this film's story with Kaithi was exceptional. By hinting to re-watch Kaithi before entering into Vikram world, there started a phenomenal hype towards the film. Now coming to the film, Kamal sir did what is needed for the film. A subtle and tremendous performance. Fahadh in the other hand a unsung lead for the film, who untie the knots to make us more interesting. Vijay Sethupthi had the lower screen space and less performance comparing to the others. The last freaking cameo of Suriya was outstanding and a brilliant move to put on us on edge. Whole audience erupted. Now coming to the flaws the story was much predictable and screenplay was slow at some points in both first half as well as second half but overall a out and out action flick with suprise elements and terrific perfomers. Aniruth travels us with his music throughout the film with efficient energy. Overall a satisfied watch.

","<span class=""review-date"">11 June 2022</span>","
So much excitement for VIKRAM. Based on a character of the same name from the 1986 movie VIKRAM who was a RAW Agent.The basic story here goes as Amar (Fahad) and his team of Black Squads take up the case of high-profile murders (serial killings) that eventually leads them to Santhanam (Vijay Sethupathi), a drug lord and the ""Ghost"", realizing that everything isn't what it seems to be! It's all out guns and glory from then on!The buzz for VIKRAM was there for a few years and then picked up momentum when the first teaser was released almost one and half years ago. The first teaser was just that. A tease! Director Lokesh Kanakaraj said in an interview before the release of VIKRAM that the teaser scenes were just shot to create a buzz among people. It had nothing to do with the actual movie though it gave us a taste of how the movie would be. The excitement peaked while watching with an audience comprising mostly of Tamilians and a some Malayalis. Hoots, Whistles, Cheers, Claps....it was a wild ride on and off screen. It was great to see that both Tamilians and Malayalis shouted out for both Malayalam and Tamil actors alike. No discrimination. Pure love for the actors. Just euphoria!This is one of the most stylish mass action thriller movies out there now and it has incited mass hysteria among the audience as well! One of Lokesh's best. Though his ""Maanagaram"" will always be my favorite. Followed by ""Kaithi."" Kaithi was a ground breaking gangster movie, so fast paced, almost shot completely at night, on the road, out and out action with a sentimental thread of a father and daughter yearning to meet each other. Actor Karthi was awesome as Dilli. Now those who haven't watched ""Kaithi"", must check it out as it too has connections with this new VIKRAM. You can say Lokesh is creating his own cinematic universe, the LKCU or LCU! He has created a script that makes VIKRAM an extension of the movie ""Kaithi."" VIKRAM is one of those rare movies that has stayed true to its genre and trailers. You watch the trailer, you get an idea of what you will be watching and you get exactly that and more with utmost satisfaction. That is quite rare nowadays, as most trailers pump you up but the movie fizzles out! Some scenes remind you of a Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez/Martin Scorcese (Scorcese is one of Lokesh's favourite Hollywood Director) style of movie making which is not bad at all because it results in visually stunning action scenes and set pieces. The movie has some of the most gruesome and creative kills and gore for an Indian movie! With excellent cinematography by our very own Girish Gangadharan, who is also a National Film Award winner for Best Cinematography for the 2019 film ""Jallikkattu"", which itself is an insanely beautiful/magical world captured on camera! Visually, Jallikattu was an immersive experience! Expected nothing less from LJP, the magician! Girish Gngadharan is also famous for his 11 minute single long take for the climax of the movie ""Angamaly Diaries"", another LJP movie.Coming to the actors, Fahad Fazil is no stranger to intense characters. His Black Squad agent Amar, is sharp, dedicated and cold blooded as well. His difficulty in maintaining a love life while keeping the nature of his job a secret, seems so genuine. The one who acts with his eyes, Fahad is in every way the perfect agent to step into Kamal's shoes, if ever the story takes that route. Fahad, as always is terrific in his role. Probably a cake walk for him. Both Fahad and Kamal has those intense eyes that tell us a million stories with one look. Kamal Haasan is back after a hiatus of almost 4 years. Vishwaroopam 2 was his last outing and it didn't do too well at the box office. Kamal once again proves why he is called ""Ulaga Nayagan"" (Universal Hero). At 67, he reprises his Secret Agent role from the 1986 movie VIKRAM. 36 years later! Though it's not ground breaking acting (not needed here) like some of his older famous characters, the moment he enters the picture, right from the beginning of the movie with the song ""Pathala Pathala"", you are mesmerized. When Kamal cries in a certain scene, you feel it too. Once upon a time, there lived a Ghost! Who is the Ghost? I'm not saying anything!Vijay Sethupathi seemed to be having a lot of fun as drug kinkpin Santhanam. A recent drug bust rattles him up and he needs to find and get it back. (This is connected to the movie, Kaithi). And that is all I will say about that! But Vijay Sethupathi was also terrific. Pretty much straight forward bad guy with certain unique nuances (a joy to watch) and a sudden jolt of power inducing drug that he pops into his system in times of need! Kalidas Jayaram had a minor role and he performed well. Surya as Rolex in a cameo role (around 5 mins) stunned everyone! He was fire on screen which resulted in the audience screming out at the top of their lungs for his mind blowing performance. Terror personified! Narain as Bejoy, also reprises his character from ""Kaithi"" and did his part well. Chemban Vinod Jose as Police Chief is also good. Vasanthi is a name and actress to look out for. I can't say anything else about that. üòÉ Post intermission there are a few big twists and reveals that we never see coming! Never! And they are all done so well, so smooth! The 2h 26m runtime feels like a breeze! Kudos to Editor Philomin Raj. Spectacular editing as the movie is quite fast paced. Music Director Anirudh Ravichandran could be considered as a hero of the movie as well because if it wasn't for his music/bgm, VIKRAM would never be elevated to this level! What a badass backgroud score! Even when it's not about action on screen. It is already my new ringtone! The title track, incorporating the ""Vikram Vikram"" theme from the original 1986 movie is outstanding. As well as the melodius number ""Porkanda Singham..."" ""Pathala Pathala"" is a fun song to watch, though I am not a big fan of that one. Whenever there is a scene where Kamal has to walk towards or away from the screen, the Vikram.... Vikram...title song pops up and it's goosebumps!! Wow! Action by Anbariv , the stunt choreographer duo Anbu & Arivu is a class apart. Creative, unique and violent at times. There are certain action scenes that we have never seen before! Awesome!Lokesh is a Kamal fanboy and this is his fanboy moment. But what differentiates him from others is that inspite of all these 3 acting powerhouses together, it is still a Lokesh Kanakaraj movie. He did not have to conform to the mega stars' image! Which is exactly why the movie, BEAST didn't work as it should have! Lokesh has set the groundwork for a new cinematic universe with more sequels in the pipeline. Next could be Kaithi-2 or a Vikram-3 or both! After watching Vikram, thinking about the possibility of Karthi, Kamal, Fahad and Surya together in one movie peaks my interest so much! There are so many stories to be told, so many angles to be thought of! Kamal already hinted at a full fledged movie with Surya and him together. Awesome! Kamal, Fahad and Vijay Sethupathi played their roles to perfection.VIKRAM is a well designed ode to Kamal Haasan. A kick-ass, adrenaline-fuelled ode that deserves the blockbuster label it is now garnering.Watch VIKRAM in cinemas to get the full effect of a mass action movie. But brush up on Kaithi too before that. Enjoy!

Cheers for talented writer and director getting absolute freedom to make whatever they want, however they want ü•ÇWe need more highly talented Indian writers and directors like him BUT our cinema has been mostly reactionary and far behind in terms of breaking the boundaries of filmmaking and storytelling and making landmark movies and defining genres and subgenres, this need to be changed as quick as possible and which requires our filmmakers and writers to give absolute freedom to make whatever they want however they want only then high quality original films could be made. I understand nothing is truly original in every level but still.

","<span class=""review-date"">5 June 2022</span>","
Saw Vikram yesterdayIts a good movie with edge of the seat entertainment.However I must say Kaithi remains the best of Lokesh Kanagaraj,Vikram can be titled as Fahad fasil in Vikram, because most of the time the story revolves around Fahad fasil, Kamal hassan has lesser screen time even below Chemban VinodStory is neatly written and excecated, it got lot of grip in Interval , Climax scenes, Cinematography is excellent as well as costume selection, Kamal hassan had best costumes which makes him fit and neat.Sentiments portions, Songs were lagging phase.Fahad fasil, Chemban vinod and all other supporting casts acted very well. Vijay sethupathi became a clich√©d villain hence didnt felt like a good act.There were some scenes which makes the audience stupid like Why kamal had to act as a bad guy infront of Kalidas' wife, Vijay sethupathi's family history (not sure why it was added), Vasanthi (agent Tina's) fight scene - she was asking to call kamal many times where she couldve called in first place,It took 10 minutes where they said regarding 3 km to reach at the end but fahad fasil managed to save the kid and appear from nowhere at the end within seconds.Surya's villain role went well but the motive remains clich√©d, just to show he is the main villain the usual villain gimmick called ""kill the gang member who brought the bad news"" is applied.Like these there are many flaws and dumb scenes, however for a flick which entertains us, Vikram is enough.This movie got a long run time around 2 hours and 50 minutes, hence we can feel that at the end many scenes were cut short.If a regular movie buff who watched Better call saul, nobody, accountant, Dark night - can make out many scenes literally copied from thoseLike underground lab from Better call saul
black squad from nobody
safe house scenes from accountant
ending scenes from dark nightBottom line - a good watch in 2022
Its coming in hotstar incase if you miss it in theatre.

","<span class=""review-date"">15 July 2022</span>","
The movie is about series of mysterious murders and it's connection to drug rackets run by 'Rolex' (set in the same universe as Kaithi) (spoiler free synopsis)The first half is better than the second half according to me. I came here looking for a suspense movie and the first half provided exactly that. Second half was all about loud stylized action, just like KGF or Pushpa.In the first half, the audience learn about characters by observing their actions and decisions. Not much is told but shown. Kamal's character and background is shrouded in mystery though. This is evident from the trailer (which too, thankfully, didn't reveal anything!)However, there are small hidden details (easter eggs) to look out for, and references to Kaithi and Kamal's previous films are fanboy moments for die hard fans. The film expects the audience to be attentive to detailThere are also some brilliantly shot scenes, revealing them would be a spoiler! Cinematography and Action Choreography join hands, are in sync, and they're way better than other films of the same genre. The songs are placed properly and don't feel like break from the plot.The story and screenplay is way too old and clich√© to be called good. This is just a massala commercial film with better suspense, cinematography, detailed action than other films of the same genre.

Kamal and feasible prove themselves. Well kamal done it already. But did it again. Background music is good and choreography also done properly. Only drawback is it's length of the movie. I think it's long scene for hero introduction scene and fight scenes. Otherwise movie pakka. Worth watching for movie lovers.

The story and screenplay of the movie is good but the first half of the movie slows down the movie a lot. The last 50 minutes of the movie is the highlight of the movie. If there were no last 50 minutes in the movie, then the movie would be a flop. The last 50 minutes of the movie saved the movie from being flop. Kamal Hasan's performance is good. Fahadh Faasil, Vijay Sethupathi and everyone else's performance is good. Background music is the best. This background music made each scene very special and turned it into gold. Completely action movie. The cameo scene of the last suriya was powerful. The length of the movie could be reduced a bit. Minimum 10 to 15 minute scenes could be cut from the movie. Looking forward to the next movie in this series.

1. In the movie there is atleast 200 characters I guess running, chasing , shooting people. Each main character had atleast 20 to 30 characters along with them.2. we don't know why they are shooting what they are trying to do..why they are chasing.3. And there comes the same old drug mafia gang story with no storyline and too many gun shots scene.4. I think loki likes big machine guns and it put those same machine guns scenes in this movie and night scenes with car headlight shots and too many vehicles like kaithi. Seems he got more influence from kaithi.5. Maanagram and Kaithi was best, master and this movie is average and they are creating so much hype in social media.The movie is hyped by fan boys..so be careful about other 10/10 ratings.

I was watching in Telugu. The screenplay of the movie is not intriguing. Unpractical scenes. The movie misses the energy, and gets you boring 1/4th way. Worst acting, unnecessary scenes, such a drag movie. Cannot see kamal hasan in such serious roles. He is fat and he is fit for nothing. I can't understand why imdb expects me to write 600 characters of review if there is nothing worth writing about... However getting back to the movie, I would also say that I have wasted precious more than 1hr of my time. And I also do not understand why people like such movies and rate the highest.. RIP kollywood.

As I have already seen the opposite it's completely crafted with a story feature like the movie ""Rambo: Lost Blood""! . What story feature is it? - ""How the spy, who has meticulously completed various gruesome targets, sacrifices himself to an unavoidable predicament that occurs in his family in his adulthood! And how he accomplished the goal he intended to accomplish with it!"" It is true that ""Lokesh Kanagaraj"" has given his best through his style of film making! . And, it is inevitable that ""Lokesh"" after ""Thiyagaraja Kumararaja"" is handling a new kind of feature in Tamil language cinema that brings the characters created in his craft in a straight line or passes through!

Kamal hassan looks very old in this movie from the first scene onwards and when the movie is about this same person fighting this much is not acceptable by everyone. Vijay sethupathi fight scenes was also poorly edited, like his punches in movie does't have any powerful effect. Fahad fassil acting was great. Chemban Vinod I don't much to say. The story is not a good one, the child character was inappropriate.etc.

","<span class=""review-date"">3 June 2022</span>","
As many Kamal Haasan fans are now as old or older than him, initial excitement was about watching this with their family (kids/grandkids). Alas, the swearing in the trailer signalled that this is not to be watched with parents. The movie is for the new generation maybe, not for everyone...One can digest only so many ""build-up"" scenes before yawning and ultimately, having more stars builds even more hype. Yet, the lack of emotional depth fizzes away any reason to continue watching this frivolous attempt. In short, this could be a political wagon for the centrists if one keeps in mind the songs like ""Por kanda singam"" (""Battle-experienced Lion""). With lyrics stereotyping the slum dwellers of Chennai, I'm not sure how many more battlefields this acting king can dance in. (""Aandavar"" = ""Ruler"" ? What was ruled in real life?) Good luck, go educate your kids instead of teaching unbridled violence in the name of vigilantism or self-appointed championing of justice.If you liked this, good for you!! Stop pushing everyone to watch this just cause you want a Tamil film to beat KGF/Baahubali/Dangal in collections.. PeaceThe annoying loudness of the fans is comparable to pointlessly excessive violence and bloodshed in the film itself.. For non-fanboys, the three hour length of the film is a minus pointWith a lacklustre screenplay and acting/characterisation without nuances, we cannot expect any Oscars for this film. Maybe fans as mindless as this film will make this run in the theaters.

What exactly will motivate you to watch #Vikram in cinemas? The amazing star cast comprising of Kamal Haasan who plays the title role, Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi. The story is simple. Some cops are brutally bumped off by a group of masked men. The prime suspect is a menacing drug lord with a golden tooth. But why were these cops specifically targeted? Were they corrupt? Were they womanizers and alcoholics? Performances are excellent. The scene where a house help single handedly fights off her attackers is brilliant. Running time needs to be reduced by 20 minutes. Rating 3/5.

The suspension of disbelief never really kicked in because most of the scenes (be it fight or even the logical sequence of events) were highly unrealistic.The alleged fan moments of Kamal fell really flat, the plot line was very poor, the film could have trimmed to 2hrs and still you would not have missed any details of the plot.

Everyone are applauding the movie for many reasons, let me be neutral on every aspect.Story is nothing new, Screenplay is the hero and the way the director tried to connect his other movie is commendable, hope the sequel will give us all a proper idea as to why he connected that movie to this.Major roles could have been done by any other actor, one character that stood out and can't be replaced is Fahadh Fasil. Kamal has done his part very well, no blame, but there is very less acting scope for an actor like Kamal - but a pure class-mass movie (the kind of entertainer that major audience would love).Dialogues and Background score are another major factor that we could not feel the hassle of watching a 3 hr long movie.One - Liner: Its definitely a high octane action movie but not an actor's movie.

I went in to watch Kamal Haasan Garu but little fid i know i will be walking out as a fan of Lokesh sir & Aniruddha sir. This movie has it all Great Acting, Good Story but Screen play, Direction & BGM is what steals the show for me after Tumbbad this is the only movie where the score is top notch. Though KGF has good score too but what's served in Vikram is on whole another level.. I hate only the part where they overdo the action scenes which has been the trademark of South Indian Cinemas but i think it's high time to move on from that & focus more of Direction, Storyline, etc. I wish they had done better promotions this movie deserved a box office collection similar to KGF2.

Most overrated India movie of all time. Poor story, with about a hundred logical mistakes. Pathetic characters, who're trying to be oversmart, but lack wits and smartness. Extremely bad action scenes for an action movie. Lots of good acters over-acting regularly. I really don't understand the people giving 9 and 10 out of 10 stars to this movie, and comparing it to the blockbusters of South Indian cinemas like Baahubali, KGF and RRR. I'm sure these people don't even know why these movies are so good. Vikram is far from any average movie. It's pure trash that doesn't deserve an average rating above 5.

Genuinely a great movie. It's been a while since we had a mystery/thriller/action movie that was actually well done. This movie has amazing character development and every single character have great performance. No one feels off or underdeveloped. First half is slower in pace but definitely does keep you engaged in the mystery and plot. Second half is pretty high octane action and even that is extremely well done. Slightly spoiler but this movie exists in the same universe as Kaithi.Do not bother with the low reviews, it's just mostly salty audiences who have something against this movie. Definitely go watch it.

116,SivakumarBalachandran," Vikram - Wow what a movie !!!
","<span class=""review-date"">4 June 2022</span>","
My take on Vikram -
1st half - An engaging Investigative crime thriller drama
2nd half - A fully pumped up action thrillerVikram was a pure labor of passion and a 100% directorial venture of Lokesh so far in his filmography. I loved ""Kaithi"" movie but when I compare it with Vikram the daughter sentiment portion that Kaithi had was taking a bit more space or like mellowing down the screen play where as in Vikram we see a husband trying to save his wife , a grand father trying to save his grand son, drug lord trying to save his empire but these where handled with a subtle note such a way it didn't spoil the thriller that was unfolding in front of us. Some brilliant screen play out here.There were moments in the film which audience were so invested and engrossed clapping their ways as the story unfolds.Every Technical aspect fell in place perfectly for this movie. There wasn't anything that was underwhelming for me throughout the crazy ride.For me I found this movie thoroughly engaging start to finish with the stellar cast including three mammoths of south cinematic talents whose craft speaks for itself.Ok Surya was supposed to be a surprise but boom as the spoilers went out in advance before the movie git released his character appearing wasn't having that wow factor but nevertheless he gives us a promising glimpse of the next season.Can't wait for the next instalment to see what's there in Lokesh's vision.

Tamil movie Vikram staring Kamal Hassan, Fahadh Faasil , Vijay Sethupathi in lead roles which is directed by Lokesh kanakaraj has been well crafted by a good screen play with both present and flashback scenes in a linear format is a unique touch by director, the way Fahadh Faasil starting his investigation process with his team adds a good pace in screen play, vijay Sethupathi's role of antagonist delivers a good blow to opposing characters, Mainly protagonist played by Kamal Hassan opposing all the roles with his team clears all doubts in second half , as Fahadh Faasil blows maximum with his investigation in first half with a good intermission scene, the present vikram movie is well linked with other old movies like kaithi and old movie vikram, the second half of movie starts with action packed scenes, the latest camera used here for wide angle, top angle, gun firing shots are good to see with mind blowing music by anirudh with his pathla pathla song,a good goosebumps moments for Tina's introduction sets fire on the screen, the entry of Rolex with a good bgm for him is wonderful

","<span class=""review-date"">4 June 2022</span>","
The film begins well. The Mystery is maintained till the first half . There are good moments and surprises in the second half. If one take out the gory violence the movie is a good thriller. The violence makes the film toxic and is definitely not recommended for children below 14. I made a mistake of taking my son and though he did like the thrills it is not a film that children should see and it is not a film that we should allow our children to enjoy. Glorifying violence of a psychotic nature has its consequences on the mind .Being a big fan of Kamal Hassan and watched several of his films over the last few decades I was very excited to see Vikram and he does not disappoint with his acting. He is better in the film that some of his recent past films. For that matter on the acting front everyone performs. The direction is also good. The music is too loud and in combination to the violence will give a migraine attack.Overall the film could have been brilliant had there been control over certain aspects of the film. To that extent the film disappoints.My request to Kamal Hassan Sir is to do more films which can be viewed by all. Even this film sans the gory violence would have been very good. Films like Appu Raja, Sadma, Mayor Saab, Pushpak, Nayakan and several others have left such a huge impact that expectations from him are always high. I may have seen each them over 10 times, lost count actually. All the mentioned films had a deep connect with the characters which is missing in this film. This film may do well in box office numbers as the buzz is good but it does not make it to the top grade of films that have been made in the past.

Just because it is South Movie doesn't mean it's nice. People who are against Bollywood for a reason. They're biased against judging South Movies, but I must say Vikram is not that movie. The story is predictable after Half n Hour. Screenplay is weak. Kamal Haasan acting is lame. He should take voluntary retirement from films. The second lead actor has performed well. Action scenes are placed well. Vijay Sethupathi is the best part of the Movie. Undoubtedly, his acting can't be judged he is the best of best. South People judge movies by emotions not by their conscience.

","<span class=""review-date"">8 July 2022</span>","
For the first hour or so the movie tends to function more like an investigative thriller rather than an out-and-out money-minting commercial venture. Even if the approach seems a bit unusual at that point in time, the story and the characters on the other hand grow on us, albeit in a gradual manner.And then comes the second half and the whole dynamic suddenly changes, we get to witness a drastic tonal alteration that eventually led us, the spectators, to a gratifying third act, fraught with palpable drama, bombastic action pieces, and some unrelenting swag and flamboyancy from the core ensemble. The entirety of the climax is such a treat to watch.Although I have to confess, it is certainly not a flawless implementation, by no stretch of the imagination one can make such bold claims. It, for sure, had its fair share of problems and drawbacks but Man! I gotta say, Mr. Kanagaraj knows how to make all these films work! The trickery lies in his spirited presentation, and the exhilarating Music by Anirudh took things even further. Another banger of a composition to hum and remember for a very long time.P. S. Everybody is singing praises (deservedly so) of Suriya's cameo as Rolex, oops! My bad it's 'Sir' Rolex; as was anticipated, but for me, it's Agent Tina who came as a surprise, and that too at a crucial juncture; needless to say, she caught me off guard for a moment or two. What a revelation!

Vikram review :Probably a bit too late considering the film released in cinemas more than a month ago; Vikram was a smash hit down south but didn't muster an encouraging response in its Hindi dubbed version which is quite surprising as I found it top notch and significantly better than the Southern fare like Pushpa (2021), RRR (2022) and KGF Chapter 2 (2022) which broke records in the Hindi belt. Vikram deserved to perform just as well, if not more than them and hence, this review cum appreciation note!!I have seen each and every Kamal Haasan film in Hindi starting from his blockbuster Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981) right upto his Vishwaroopam 2 (2018). In between, I have kept track of his regional accomplishments as well like Appu Raja (1990), Mayor Saab (1990) and of course the iconic Nayakan (1987). Vikram even references a famous dialogue from that Mani Ratnam classic. Undoubtedly, Kamal justifies his title of 'Ulaga Nayagan' meaning a global level hero in Vikram and the sixty seven year old star shines in each and every scene he appears...Kamal Haasan plays a mysterious alcoholic guy presumed dead but is very much alive and kicking and turns out to be the titular agent on a dangerous mission. Fahadh Faasil plays a secret agent himself who uncovers Kamal's truth and also cracks the lead to a mega drug syndicate led by the sinister Vijay Sethupathi. By the way, Sethupathi's entry turns out to be one of the film's highlight scene as he springs up bare chested from an auto rickshaw turned turtle. Another great moment is when an ordinary maid (Vasanthi) transforms in to a killing machine least unexpectedly...Director Lokesh Kanagaraj keeps his narrative style a tad confusing in the first half but once the cards are revealed to us, the second half goes full blaze in action mode. The climax where Kamal Haasan goes cannon blasting makes for a truly pulsating moment! The film ends with an introduction of another key character who presumably, will play a crucial part of Vikram 2. Bring it on fast, Lokesh Kanagaraj!! I won't miss that in theatres for sure..Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.

Got led into viewing by the hype created.Missing this movie, you are not losing anything.Irrational and senseless killing. Boring.Absurdly taking back and forth. Guns and fire power does not constitute a good or great movie.If any credit, Fahadh Faasil has presented quality showmanship.Why Surya? Why Vijay Sethupathi?!Disjoint sub stories, made to feel as a layered completion and struggling to weave them together.It appears the ratings are from Hyped up promotions and mass marketing events.If one is reasonably exposed to world wide cinemas, this would make sense and relate to them.!!

","<span class=""review-date"">10 June 2022</span>","
Lokesh has proved why he is unique among the other upcoming directors but his style is getting quite repetitive reminding of Tarantino's style. He doesn't give us a proper intro to the story and pushes us straight into the world of Vikram making us struggle for some time to make sense of what's going on. Music and songs are great perfectly reflecting the tones of Vikram but it felt unnecessarily bloody and noisy at times. Though the camera work is outstanding, It does not give the chills we got from watching director's Kaithi for the first time keeping in mind that the stories of both are predictable.Cast is amazing. Another gem in Kamal's crown. For an actor this age his work in action scenes are almost perfect and his emotional acting is PERFECT as ever. Fahad gets most screen time and he uses it best to get the perfect landing in Tamil Cinema and as his fan I hope he gets more such roles. Vijay Sethupathi is somewhat disappointing. While his acting and body language is only getting better with each movie, his dialougues are nearly incomprehensible like 90 percent of the time. It might be intentional for this particular character but is off-putting sometimes.We get another Amazing Malayalam Actor Chemban Vinode Jose with a meaty role. The way it is tied with Kaidhi and gets us Bejoy, Adaikalam Gang and a Glimpse of Dilli gets us excited for a Big Franchise. Surya's cameo as a gangster comes off as a disturbing character. Getting Kamal, Surya and Karthi so close in a movie is already an accomplishment that only a Kollywood fan can celebrate.

Please do not be fooled by the reviews. The film does not have any plot, the action scenes are poorly shot, the acting is cliched, the direction is contrived and its a pure waste of time. Please do not waste another 200 crore rupees by bringing the sequel. Kamal Hassan should be at least respectful to his own age. Nothing really works in the movie. I am wondering how I could finish it. Maybe I was expecting some sort of turnaround towards the end which unfortunately was not there. Vijay Sethupati was totally wasted. I mean practically we should not discuss about this movie at all. It has nothing. Better watch Shamshera or even Prithviraaj which I believe must be better than this punishment. It is a shame that when the country is so upbeat about the South Indian films, they are still making such idiotic movies. Not at all acceptable.My rating is 5 out of 10. I should have given it 3. 2 more points for the respect I have for Mr. Hassan.Watch it at your own risk. You must be having something better than this piece of ... to watch.

I have only come to know about Lokesh Kanagaraj after the hype started around Master. Because of my friends' recommendation I watched both of his previous ventures Kaithi and Maanagarm and got very impressed with his narrative and filmmaking. However Master kind of let me down irrespective of some brilliantly shot sequences and the antagonist role. For the same reason, I had my reservations about watching Vikram, wondering if Kanagaraj could handle one of the biggest stars of Tamil industry along with 2 other most sought out South Indian actors of recent times. Finally I watched it 10 days into the release hearing all the good things about it.Vikram is quite a blast literally and figuratively. It is an action thriller similar to Kaithi but with more backstory to it. Although it is not as fast paced as Kaithi, Vikram is unique in its own way and isn't trying too hard to please the fans of Kamal Hassan. The movie has quite a bit of connection to Kaithi and I only wish the director would have made the audience aware of it much earlier. It is almost a sequel to Kaithi but it is also not. However it is quite clear by the climax that Lokesh Kanagaraj is set to build something of his own and it looks very very promising.Kamal Hassan plays a very subdued role until the banger of an interval scene which is probably the best moment of the movie post which his character gets more weight to it. It is Fahadh Fasil who has more screen time and is also brilliant as always. Although Vijay Sethupathi excels is fiery and excellent in his role, his character writing and makeup reminds you of his Master's role you almost end up calling him Bhavani. The best surprise is the Agent Tina character played by Vasanthi and the action sequence involving her created such a roar in the theater. Other supporting characters get their fair share of interesting moments which is also a trademark of Lokesh Kanagaraj's filmmaking. The final scene introducing the Rolex character feels like the start of a new movie but no one's complaining.Vikram is a pathway which could probably lead to more of its kind and hopefully will lead to more multi starrer movies in the future without having to balance individual stardoms.

Positives-

Too much and unnecessary emphasis to the action sequences which could have been cut short to explore the characters further.Some scenes seem to miss logicFor example-
In the interval action sequence, why doesn't anyone shoot Vikram although he is surrounded on all sides?Why does Vikram and Santhanam need to have fist fight at the end when they could use weapons.Vikram uses all kinds of weapons throughout the movie and the scene just before this but when it comes to fighting at the end, it's fist fight just like a typical Indian movie.

What a fantastic film Vikram , it should be watched by all cinema lovers. So sad to see in North it got selected screens. Imagine if this film celebrated like Pushpa and Kgf this would be bigger hit than any film made in india. Can't imagine Kamal Haasan Sab , Fahad Fasil and vijay sethupati in a single film . Writer and director gave justice to all their lead actors and characters . Even first half is lead by fahid fasil and vijay sethupati. Waiting for the second part there will be Rolex aka Surya to rock on. Can't imagine someone can write this kind of script in hindi cinema and can make with this kind of professionalism. What hindi industry can do is dub more professionally so wider audience can enjoy the film with it's whole ethnicity . And distributors have to give equal screens to south films as they are giving to any hindi film. And the best part of this films is they are not celebrating patriarchy and irrational heroism like kgf & pushpa.

Vikram , Lokesh Kanakaraj movie in which producer kamal hassan speaks first lengthy dialogue only in second half . Which confirms his zero interference on lokesh.Must watch in low noise environment with least distraction to catch up with speed of screenplay.Fahadh - class act , eyes were speaking more than body.VJS - thara local mass only with body language scores even on most unexpected areas, as you watch you dont know when he will score but sometimes even outshines kamal.Kamal- like a seasoned politician lets fafa and vjs score in first half , he takes control in second half and just takes off like a supersonic rocket, and at this age competes with body language of vjs / expression of fafa and acting is like a headmaster.His appearance is like cameo in first half but second half he just swallows all the stars with his performance.Fourth hero in movie is bgm that action packed entertainer well complemented by anirudh scores.Non spoiler alert , If you havent watched kaidhi better watch it and go else it will be like kamal movie unable to understand.Surya : surprise package , i did not find that exciting , as that surprise element could have been done better in movie.Negative : Kamal could have been used more on some of action scenes as in second half scenes had enough scope like vishwaroopam -1 but some of his scenes were slightly ordinary but just that subsequent scenes he outshone as rockstar so viewer might feel like why not the same energy in previous shot ( its director miss rather than kamal miss) .With so many stars sometimes there is lack of some logic which can be given a benefit of cinematic liberty üòÇ.Planning to watch may be two more times for Lokesh kanagaraj story and screenplay.After kurthipunal next full fledged kamal hassan action movie I liked most.If a webseries is taken nay be there can be 9 full episodes by just spinning off these characters.

Hats off to anirudh what a stylish BGM like KGF talking about the cinematography & direction, damn!! I am stunned its just fabulous!!! Very well shot and very smartly executed.. well few days before i was waiting for some good suspence thrillers.. and here i got this..

This movie is awesome in first part, but comedy in second part, if Kamal Haasan had plan to reveil his face, why did he not protect his grandson first? If Tina knew that they were coming she could have bought the little Vikram to safe room, when Kamal Haasan and agent uppilia knew that the short guy followed them, then why did not he try to protect his grandson? And after a baby's heart stopped for more than 10 mins how is he not brain dead?And one big question is why did agent Lawrence did not follow Vikram's order?And please improve on ur CGI (baby's face)

Vikram is a must must watch film. Before watching it watch Kaithi movie because there is a reference in VIKRAM. What an acting by the trio KAMAL HASSAN, VIJAY SETHUPATHI, FAHADH FAASIL. Super duper action thriller movie. This movie is a dad of KGF. Mainly the entry of actor SURIYA.... Only 5 mins role... WHAT A LOOK. Final twist in the movie given by Suriya. You won't even find bored soo intense film. Must must watch in theatres. BEST PAN-WORLD FILM.

It didnt bore even a second My personal favorite thing was Vijay sethupati's entry and the cute mature love story between fahad and his wife in the movie..and one loo bomb scene...i was like whattt theeee helll and booom superb scenes...Kamal Hassan holds the script so tight well packed bgm is also good. Direction is class as well..Kamal Hassan, Vijay Sethupathi & Fahadh fassil have blasted on screen. If that wasn't enough Suriya added the additional heat in the climax. What a movie. Lokesh Kanakraj is a master craftsman.

A part of Lokesh Kanagaraj universe, Vikram is the second installment after Kaithi. This follows Kamal Hassan seeking revenge for his son's murder.The action scenes were good, although the narrative was weak. Fahad Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi were brilliant and the climax cameo of Surya was terrific. At almost 3 hours runtime, Vikram felt tired at times, as if the mantra of killing for revenge was the only thing the movie was focusing about. There were sudden developments at certain points, which instead of getting revealed as a suspense, felt predictable. To summarise, Vikram was a good action movie, and watching Kamal Hassan as a badass hero was pleasant to watch.My Rating : 7/10.

162,omsupport-53739," Disgraceful movie for the actual VIKRAM 1986 movie
","<span class=""review-date"">3 June 2022</span>","
The original vikram (1986) was one of the technologically advanced science fiction movie that was possible only at Hollywood big budget movies of that time. Except for the title and a few seconds of information about lead artist's past (Kamal Hassan) there is no justice to use the name VIKRAM particularly if you have watched the original VIKRAM and liked it.This movie simply wasted three great artists' skills. First half of the movie (the length of usual full Hollywood movie) there are too many characters, too many puzzles and too many scenarios as if like they are preparing the audience for another 10 - 15 future sequels/ prequels. The second half has some good scenes though (reason for 3 star rating). Nevertheless second half too consist of too many characters and scenarios that at one point you would get confused with the names.At one point you feel like you are seeing some kind of South Indian film festival, as you will see so many known artists coming and going just for seconds. What's the point Mr. Director and story/screenplay writers?Kamal has innumerable successful films and Vijay sethupathi is a rising star. Why do they act in movies like this? (Why Vijay sethupathi is doing the same fist punch that he did in MASTER movie? One sample of irrelevancy). After watching recent movies like Unami pol oruvan, vishwaroopum-1, master, etc, in recent past and watching this **** it is very upsetting if you are a genuine fan for Kamal and Vijay acting skills.

Honestly wasn't expecting the movie to be this good. This movie is a treat to those who love technical details in a movie. The casting is exceptional, the team behind editing, cinematography, screenplay have done a great job. The cinematography and the color tone of the movie is very much the same as Kaidhi. Anirudh's has done a decent job with background scores as well.. was already a fan of lokesh's previous movies, vikram raised another bar.

Will give 10-stars for Kamal who at his age of 72 years, looks and continuous to act like how he was in his 30-40s. Brilliant acting by Fahaad and Vijay Sethupathi.However the script is to dragging, extreme amount of unrealistic violence, way too noisy background score for all action scenes. A rating of 9 after a week on screens is way too exaggerated for this flick. To do justice to other IMDB movies that are rated 9 & above, I'm dragging my rating for this Vikram movie to 2. If movie like VIKRAM VEDHA is 8.2 on IMDB, this movie should be worth no more than 7.

Lokesh here makes an attempt to bring Kollywood its own fictional shared universe like Hollywood's MCU. From his previous films, we could say connecting different parallel events and making all the characters from different scenarios coming all together for the final showdown is his prime talent. So, he is the best man to do this job of creating this fictional universe and He does this job exceptionally well. The events of kaithi are brilliantly connected to VIkram and Both share a really good Universe. We have some really good cameos (not to mention Actor Suriya's role that was lit) and the way the movie ends has really set up new ways for Kaithi 2 and Vikram sequel (and many more who knows!!).All the actors in the film have done a really great job. You would become an instant fan of Kamal. Vijay Sethupathi has a really interesting characterisation who looks frightening and makes you laugh at the same time. Fahad Fahsil was Incredible. Even his eyes show different emotions. Seeing Suriya with this negative role was exciting and different but it was great.A really entertaining story. Watching Kaithi once would actually help you understand the plot more easily. The events of the film take place at a really high pace. So watching it twice would give you a better understanding. The story has a lot of twists throughout the film. Stunt Scenes were really entertaining!! (Anbariv just keeps on entertaining us movies after movies - beast,kgf2,etc). New Camera techniques were used perfectly. One would notice This technique was previously used in Master and Beast in small amounts.BGM was rocking. Anirudh proved once again why He is the Rockstar. Been giving hits after hits. All variations were awesome and perfectly used.The only thing disappointing in this film is its VFX. They could have done better. We have seen scenes in Beast how the VFX have evolved in Kollywood. It's sad a film of this level has poor vfx. It degrades the viewing experience. Nevertheless, It is still highly entertaining. They need to get a better vfx in future films.Final Verdict: A must watch. Action movie fans would love this film!! Try not to miss the big screens. A Highly entertaining movie which is rewatchable. Looking forward to the sequels.Rating: 9.5/10.

Film review : Vikram ( Starring Kamal Haasan, Fahadh Faasil & Vijay Sethupati)
#sanjuzzreviews #VikramMovie #KamalHaasan #fahadfazil #VijaySethupathi
Story : A ruthless Black Ops team headed by Fahadh Faasil is called up by the commissioner of police to hunt down masked vigilantes who are killing police officials. An exception to their rule is the killing of a civilian Karnan ( Kamal Haasan) who is the father of a martyred police officer. Is Karnan actually who he seems ? Why the exception to the vigilantes rule. Is there a deeper conspiracy involved ?The first half is fast paced, thrilling & all about Fahadh Faasil who is absolutely brilliant in his role as a Black Ops officer as he goes about the investigation. Rules the first half totally. He overshadows the mighty Kamal Haasan ( for whom i had actually gone to see the film) .The second half is all about Kamal Haasan who is shown as the Tamil Salman Khan especially towards the climax. No complaints about his acting, but some of the action scenes are really over the top .. the Hero is indestructible to say the least. Narrative slows down a bit with some emotional scenes. Ending is total Maar Dhaad and Vijay Sethupati proves to be a worthy adversary to our protagonists.Brilliant casting, action and a fast paced narrative make it a worthwhile watch.My rating 3/5 .. Worth a dekho.. adios üôÇ

I enjoyed every bit of this movie bcoz it's very intriguing. The acting is top notch by our very own Kamal Sir,Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupati was also too good. The actions scenes with that blockbuster Anirudh's BGM does the rest of the job. I have to write that even Kamal Sir's chewing,his facial expressions at intermission, in emotional songs and in last fight showed us why he is one of best actors of all time in world. He is truly Ulaganayagan.#LivingLegend.

I would give 9.7 out of 10 for this movie. This is a pakka commercial entertainer with well carried roles of everyone. Fahad takes the soul till the pre interval and passes to Ulaganayagan Kamal sir as said he proved his world class in the remaining of the movie. Vijaysethupathi has done his role well but little bit missed to grab the presence while watching. The surprise of agents will be a blast in theatre. Expression of kamal sir especially the song porkanda singam to melt the heart and the whole movie and his actions proves himselt the youngest. Fahad fasil was justified by the director in presence. All the reference from Vikram (old) movie and Kaithi were justified. As we could say its an indian multiverse from the hands of Lokesh Kanagaraj proving himself as an icon for the future directors. I somehow felt that Suriya sir doesn't suit for the role provided but its too early to say so wait till the 3rd chapter of Vikram.....

Honestly after so much expectations, I was disappointed the way the movie turned out to be.The editing was horrible and movie fell flat in many places after a fantastic start. Why are the directors hell bent on portraying the hero as a super human who can do anything. Forget your senses if you want to make sense of some scenes.Farhad fasil was excellent, Vijay Sethupathi wasted and I saw kamal instead of vikram. Surya had to stop shouting, he has to learn that one can menacing even without raising their voice.Kamal fans will love it but by his own standards the movie is sub par.

This film barely manages to engage me. This film has many flaws and the screenplay is not well written. Lokesh thought that Kamal Hasan's familial bondings with grand child and son will evoke the audiences' sympathy. But, i can remember the the last sequence of Lokesh's another fantastic movie Kaithi in which Dilli said to Inspector Bijoy after getting his daughter that he does not need the gold earrings anymore for his daughter as he already got his daughter. He requested inspector Bijoy to take the earrings for his daughter instead. This one scene is better than the whole movie Vikram. Emotions don't come from familial bonds. It is best when you express it through strangers. This is Kamal Hasan fanboy movie made exclusively for the Kamal Hasan fans. Nothing else. Waste of Vijay sethupathy and Fahadh Fasil. The character of Vikram should not be revealed on interval points and his character must have to be an utter stranger and greyish tone. Disappointed. If the content does not engage me intellectually and emotionally then I cannot enjoy the action sequences. I hope next time Lokesh comes with better script.

The senile hero has projected himself as an ex Indian secret agent. He does not fit into the role. A more fit and younger looking lead would have done greater justice. However the story line resembles a cheap blend of many Hollywood movies and some Bollywood movies also.Man combating in the agressive fighting with the mask is much slimmer than the lead who has gathered mountain of flesh around himself. Kamal should stop playing the hero role as it does not suit him. Age and weight are the problems. He looks more like Bud Spencer of Hollywood.Another movie with loads of violence which is not good for the society.If it is free people can watch on OTT. Movie not worth the money .

Is there a connection between this two events?

","<span class=""review-date"">7 June 2022</span>","
Vikram is one of the best movie of the year 2022. Well written story script and action packed screenplay. Overall this movie is just amazing. The way story connected with the movie 'Kaithi' was quite surprising. Just like Marvel Universe Avengers, Director Lokesh Kanagaraj is trying to establish a Loki Cinematic Universe. Waiting for Kaithi 2 and Vikram 3. Lokesh Kanagaraj deserves a great victory and the best of everything.

The movie starts with a dance without any context which droped my expectations at the beginning.The main lead of the movie has little to none dialogues in Tamil and speaks most of the time in English which is cringe.The fight scenes lacked logic and were nothing but fillers. At one point I just skipped some parts it didn't even matter.The BGM was irritating and didnt help in any way and infact decreased my experience. Youtube vedios and ig reels have better music tn this.And the vilain of the movie is a joke and God knows wt drug he is taking which gives him super human strength.And no wonder what reason they r making 2nd part and literally they wasted 10min to show cameo of the next villain.

1st kudos for making a film so entertaining at first half. 2nd I dont get it why everyone praises the movie because of it's violence and depiction of guns which is really a plus point but that's it the movie is bombarded by a hype train how KH is and his 4 member surviving gang wreaking havoc in past and KH makes sure they dont survive i mean he literally left them to die just like indonesian movies where heroes allies are just meatbags to end up dead by villain's minions but they had some logic not this one. A hour and half would have sufficed but to sit in the seat for nearly 3 hrs aint worth it. If your ardent kH of course yeah.

Alright... where to start? The movie starts off with a shock which makes us think this isn't going to be a full on Kamal movie. You are right! It isn't!But, that's where the beauty of this movie lies! The way Lokesh adds so much importance to the script and not worry about the classic masala (which ruined Master imo) is what has made this movie a bangerSuperb BGM by Ani elevating the scenes to another level and cinematography throughout the film... it was just a treat to watchOne thing that did ruin this film was too many characters that I lost track of who is who. Can't wait for this Loki cinematic universe to turn into a series of amazing movies!

This movie should be called Kaithi 2 and ANBARIVU should claim more than half of directors remuneration. Its a relentless rain of hand to hand combats, gun shots, stabbing and pyrotechnics, so relentless you get bored. Lokesh takes a lot of inspiration from the indomitable South Koreans, you will see the centenary celebration wrecking scene from The Outlaws in Vikram, here it's a marriage function ruined using some gas emitting gizmo. By default you get thumping,bone jarring bgm which will total your eardrums. Most of the well choreographed fights happen in darkness and it cuts half of the thrill on offer. Some really exciting moments come from the most unexpected people, like Agent Tina.For high calibre performers like Fafa,VS and the Kadavul,the assigned roles are cakewalks. Almost every character has something to do and the credit goes to the writers. Hope the film does some big numbers.

Maybe it is just me but I have tried three times now and could not get past the first 20 minutes of the movie. The whole opening sequence is so boring and senseless. Maybe for die hard Kamal Hasan fans it might be OK to see him dancing without context right at the start of a movie, but I just found it very boring to get through the whole opening sequence. Don't get me wrong, I have very high respect for Kamal Hasan and the work he is done over the years. But this one unfortunately has the morning boring starts to any movie I have seen. Maybe I am missing out by not trying to power through first 20 minutes, but I tried three times !!

Yes Lokesh deserves the respects for the writing in this, both in character building and a cohesive spiderweb like screenplay. But without the emotive king in Kamal Hassan, another masala type actor is surely not going to give us the extraordinary range of his. Clearly it takes our Indian audience to enjoy products of script power to grieve masala pot boilers. Vijay Sethupathi is the one to take his mantle and Suriya too has paved the way much earlier. We need to continue to stop meddling with script writers, yes we know which masala heroes still do this. And we get flops.

Horrible movie with horrible direction and storyline.Based on South India Vs North India movies flag bearers this movie seems to be a hit but all who watched know that it is a waste of talent and such a collaboration between fine actors.1. Illogical fight sequence where no one uses gun in fight with hero for most of the times but uses knife to get killed.2. Director got lost where to keep Kamal Hasans grandson in whole movie specially in last fight, so Fahad again brings him back in the den where Kamal is fighting for life with whole building ready to explode.3. Kamal Hasan keeps his family on guard of only one lady secret agent who's eyes can open one secret safety door. Script writer took break everyday to comeback and put some stupid logic in whole movie.4. Vijay Sethupati with all his charisma and power is scared of one Rolex boss for his 60+ family members, so he keeps fighting all movie for 2 lost container of supplies of his boss.5. Fahads wife in the movie can be easily killed because in old movie Kamals wife also got killed.6. In first 15 minutes, anyone can guess tha Kamal hasans story is all bring told to distract the secret agent Fahad. Kamal hasan is such a secret agent from 30 years and he goes in places to do secret stuff where no one can trace him like golf greens, red light area window üòÄ brilliant thinkingSuch a waste of talent by poor direction, script writing and bringing Surya in end for taking 15 minutes to lay grounds for part 2 which I think should not come out with these group of Director, script writers.

They way Lokesh building each character is brilliant. The screenplay moves gripping untill the intervel portion. But after the intervel portion it is boring, because of too much action sequences. The action sequences are not even fresh. It is as usual one. New guns are only introduced. But that will not bring a fresh tone to the action sequences, because every type of gun, only release bullets and it make the target to hurt or die with some fire, sparks and explosions. If you love kaithi so much, you will like Vikram's second half.

In this time of cutting edge-new age practical and logical thriller stories like Drishyam Kamal Hassan is back with old school of south Indian style one-man-fighting-20ppl-at-a-time movie. There is absolutely nothing new in the movie. Only kamal Hassan potraying himself as Super Hero and proving again and again that come what may he is invincible one man army. Whole movie passed by but I failed to understand why on earth Kamal Hassan has made this movie. What does he wants to prove. Complete nonsense and waste of time. Come on Mr. Hassan you have given few best of the bests most memorable movies. At the age of 68 you dont need to prove anything by giving such a nonsensical movie. We need thrillers like Appu Raja, Hindustani or comedies like Chachi 420 or heart touching Sadma or Sagar if you need us to remember you as an one of the greateat story tellers of Indian cinema. Please no more idotic movies like this.Movies like Drishyam, Memories, Jay Bhim, Jana Gana Mana have raised the bar to a new level.

It's a crass action film that borrows heavily from everything you've ever watched, read, heard and loved. Music, background score, camera angles, action sequences, costumes, special effects, props, dialogues, ideas,... it's a myriad of inspirations. But they aren't executed well enough to pay tributes to the originals.It may appeal to an audience who haven't read Diamond Comics or watched Hollywood hits. Or the ones who have poor imagination and can't connect the dots.There's a bit of unintended comedy in very serious situations. Like the introduction of Special Agent Tina. Or the forced repetition of the phrase 'Once upon a time there lived a ghost'.

After hearing lot of rave reviews watched this movie on theatre. Lot of ado for an average movie I would say. Seems the director had no time to etch out any of the characters fully, no coherent script, logical loop holes in every scen, unnecessarily lengthy movie, easily couldve cut 30-40 mins of the movie and viewers wouldn't have even noticed. Director has tried to make each and every scene a goosebump scene and that makes u soon saturated the onscreen violence. He has tried to take all the impressive scena form his previous movie ""kaithi"" and has tried to exaggerate them and it falls flat. Overall a great missed opportunity.P. S last scene cameo was the worst of all.

Excellent performances by everyone. This team, multiverse concept and title are gonna rock Indian movie industry. One of the best Tamil action movies of all time. Must watch movie , especially in theatres. Sound designing is brilliant. Waiting for sequel. The climax is out of control . This movie is watchable again and again in theatre.

After watching Kaithi, I was excited to watch Vikram as both the movies are part of a universe and it was in my watchlist for a long time. The movie is good and a full theatrical experience. The BGM, action scenes, cameos and the performances of cast members were good. The direction was also good but I felt that the movie could have little short. Also, the there were some pacing issues in some scenes but it doesn't effect the overall experience. Also, the suspense element felt little bit weak to me. Now, I am excited to see how this universe will continue.Overall, it was an entertaining movie and a treat for action-drama lovers.

Well i went in with 0 expectations and still returned dissapointed. The movie had so much potential yet it all got ruined due to poor pacing and frustratingly long run time.The first 1 hr is slow but it still manages to keep you hooked because of the ""murder mystery"" plot. The movie picks up pace towards the interval.The second half is just bland. The movie tries to be so many things and ends up becoming a khichdi. The bg music is annoyingly loud. The overall acting performances are good.

I entered theatre with zero expectations but soon after I regret it. Reasons are BGM, Direction, whole back screen artists, Front screen actors, the whole movie. If some big actors are giving chance we must utilize it unlike Nelson, Lokesh used well. The bgm and music played a big role in success of this film Ani sir rocked it. I don't wanna tell about Andavar's acting skill. Everybody knows how ulaga nayagan will perform. Fahad's acting was expectionally well. VJS acting gone beserk! All other actors were performed very well. At last the cameo's performance brought goosebumps for everyone. The whole story was wholesome. The VFX also worked well. Everyone will enjoy this blockbuster. It would be more effective in big screen.

There's so many awesome things in this movie but story telling is the key point the way Lokesh present this is just mind blowing its not like ordinary movies in the first half Fahad was leading and in second half Kamal Sir nailed it. One more best part for me was Fahad sir character development so real and convincing how he changed his ideology when same things happens with him.

","<span class=""review-date"">21 June 2023</span>","
It was a superb production, no doubt about that! Great to see a splendid cast all working hard to deliver such a unique movie.Sentiments aside, Vikram was a distant reflection of Lokesh Kanagaraj's movie ""Master"". Overall, it was half sublime and half okDELICIOUS---We just want to stand up and clap for Girish Gangadharan. Grandiose photography, sir! We were blown away by the attention to the smallest details and using a camera robot for the fighting scenes, Impeccable!-Have to give it up to the casting team because Vikram was an assembly of excellent actors, it was regal.Annddddd let's not forget Agent Tina (Vasanthi) who was a mind-blowing surprise and Jaffer Sadiq (playing one of the villain's men) was unforgettable-The closing scenes were dynamite! We can't disclose more than that but we guarantee you will be delightedBLAND---Pre-intermission, there were lots of details to digest at once; the plot was going very fast without a good sense of purpose.Yes, the investigating team was chasing the masked men but so many characters came and left within seconds that the story was hard to follow. Only after the intermission that the momentum became steady and we got the whole picture-The depiction of women in Vikram was quite shocking. Gayatri, Prabhanjan's wife, and the villain's three wives all appeared like they were simply 'fooled' by love without a sense of intellect or wisdom.The men in Vikram were edgy and sharp, whereas the women (apart from agent Tina) were just 'there', not using logic. Who agrees to marry a man you know nothing about, not even his profession? Prabhanjan's wife was just a wife, clueless about the state of affairs in her own house.The villain's wives, who at least had knowledge of their husband's work, were mainly portrayed as lustful beingsMoreover, making a piece of music out of a woman moaning in the brothel scene was very demeaning-Some of the visual effects didn't turn out well and a few images were a bit grainy---Vikram had many similarities with the movie 'Master'; Vijay Sethupathi reprised his role as a drug lord while Kamal Haasan took on John Durairaj's aspect notably with the excessive drinking and the dance sequence.Both movies ended with fighting scenes in a factory.

You will also fall in love with Fahad Fasil's role and my dear friend the main villain right here (VIJAY SETHUPATI)..Ohh dear Ohh dear,I will be very honest with you all people; I haven't watched his majority of the movies,but the way he acted right here in front of us is simply overwhelming. He just nailed his role brilliantly. The music,camera angles,cinematography and even screenplay is worth appreciating.Apart from that one brothel scene it's completely safe to watch with family peoples. They could have cut those moaning scene,it's little awkward to watch that scene with family! I must warn you,this movie contains lots of bloodshed and straight neck slauthering so may not be appropriate for childrens below 14yrs.And finally I will go with 9 out of 10 Stars for it.

I was really looking up to this movie for a long time, as I am a big fan of kamal hassan. I think the movie is definitely worth the wait, but I still feel there were some things in the movie that does not allow us to completely connect with the characters in the movie, for eg: why does Fahad bring the baby back to the place where the action is going on, or why does one of the agent takes the baby right in front of enemy's to get shot, i also think they could have thought something other than killing kamal within the first 10 min, as we clearly know he is going to return somehow, so kamal comming back was not a big surprise. Really exited to watch the next part and wish to see more of kamal in it.

","<span class=""review-date"">9 June 2022</span>","
Directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, Vikram is a spiritual sequel of the 1986 film by the same name and a direct sequel to the director's Kaithi. Featuring an ensemble cast led by Kamal Haasan, Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi, Vikram is 3 hours well spent.Set after the events of Kaithi, Amar (Fahadh) is tasked with the capturing a group of masked men, who are responsible for the murder of law enforcement officials. This leads Amar to the ruthless drug lord Sandhanam (Sethupathi) and the mysterious of the presumed to be dead, Karnan (Haasan).The film benefits a lot from its immensely talented cast. Fahadh and Vijay Sethupathi own the first half and that was my favourite part. I was a tad bit letdown by the 2nd half. Even the much awaited mid-credit scene featuring a popular cameo (Suriya Sivakumar) doesn't land the required impact (maybe the sequel will).Anirudh Ravichander's music is stellar (as always). The Pablo Escobar tune during the wedding scene was epic! Among the performances, everyone has their moments. I went for Fahadh and Vijay Sethupathi and I was impressed by both their performances. Kalidas Jayaram, Chemban Vinod Jose, Narain, Gayathrie Shankar co-star.Vikram is whistle worthy & a true-blue popcorn film. Among the phlethora of event films this year, Vikram takes the top spot (above RRR, KGF 2). The cast & Anirudh deserve all the credit.

Positives:
Kamal hassan's role of raw agent was predictable but the way Lokesh kept it suspense for complete first half was excellent.With FaFa's role this movie looked as a spy film too before Kamal's Action sequences.Also Vijay Sethupathi's villain role is still looking unique.Kamal's fight after entering the house and killing villain's henchmen just for making milk for his grandson was one of the best scenes in movies ever for me.Should appreciate Lokesh as he fit his best from all the nine emotions that should exist in a movie.Agent Tina character was also unexpected and goosebumps moment.All the people whom FaFa investigated were turned out to be Kamal's team shows that Lokesh was so careful on setting the story.Minus:
At very rare areas we can see some lag.Also rolex character was revealed alot in social media and it caused to feel the lag at the end too.No of twists looked exceeded a bit.

This film has been breaking boxoffice records but I cant say it was mind blowing for me. I know the return of Kamal Hassan is one of the factors, am also glad to see him play a director's actor.The first half is well paced and keeps your attention but the second half was pure action and will be liked by action movie fans. The twists didn't work for me and the only one I enjoyed was the lady fight cameo towards the end.The casting is like a competition of the best actors in Southern film industry. Kamal Hassan, VJS and Fahadh Faasil live their characters. But the man who walks off with the trophy is Fahadh Fasil who plays a cold-blooded man in first half who has to face his weak emotional side in second half. This man is pure class and another level in current crop of actors. I don't know if VJS has put on weight only for this role or its regular size but he really needs to lose weight. Again a brilliant villian done by him.

","<span class=""review-date"">10 June 2022</span>","
Wow my mind was blown away, I just sat there as the director card fell at the end and was running my hands through my hair in total awe. Lokesh directed the film quite well, nothing was out of place or added unnecessarily as if to check boxes and the set-up for the cinematic universe was very organic. The ties to the OG Vikram film and Kaithi are there and the other films are tied in quite nicely. The pacing and cinematography was top notch with Lokesh totally mastering dark shots. Anirudh's music took the film to the next level whether it's the BGM or the perfectly placed songs.In terms of acting, casting is extraordinary and perfect as to who will best suit which character can't imagine anyone else in any of the roles. VJS is apt in his role and pulls of the intensity with a tinge of dark humor here and there although the Chota Bheem scenes with drugs were kinda weird. Next is FaFa, one of my favorites, he totally owned the first half and even the second half his scenes and overall arc was quite well designed with him dawning the role of a proper sidekick in the second half of the film. Then there is Kamal Hassan, I won't acting talk about his acting nor have to. In the history of Indian cinema, Kamal Hassan is a beautiful chapter, and Vikram is another feather in his cap. He takes over in the second half and the energy doesn't drop for a second. He has done other vigilante roles, like in Indian, but this one is totally different with high octane scenes. The scenes with his grandson and daughter in law are quite emotional and the last shot simply superbly acted and made by long for Vikram II.Last but definitely not the least Suriya, I truly wished they didn't reveal the fact that he was in the film and let the audience guess a little and be surprised at seeing him. But they revealed and slightly ruined the thrill but man oh man I never thought I would see Suriya like this. He was violent, massy, and able to send a shiver up the spine. Hyped to see how Rolex is shown in the upcoming films of the CU.Overall well made film with high octane scenes and a great undercurrent theme regarding drugs and the mafia around them. Be sure to watch Kaithi especially prior to watching the film to better piece things together or else some scenes may go over your head.

Honestly speaking, this movie is one of the most rewatchable movies that came out recently. It only gets better with each viewing. This movie is not a stupid show celebration of some superstar. This has got many stories and struggles for every character in the story. Be it Amar, bijoy, sandhanam, Agent tina, and the ghost himself. The story isn't one dimensional, it has layers around it. At first it just seems like an another typical revenge drama, but the 2nd half of the story just changes every thing about this movie.The actors are fabulous, they don't seem like acting. I felt I am seeing those characters for real.Now, the field where many movies in spite of havi g a great story and potential fail Is writing a intriguing and engaging screenplay, believe me this movie is about 2 hours and 55 minutes but it didn't bore me for even a second.Cinematography was top notch.This movie absolutely makes it to my list of favourite Indian movies

Vikram is an example of how great south indian movies can be. Even though it is an entertainer film, its serious tone, plot twists and the massively enriched background scores and frames gives the film a lot bigger canvas to build a universe itself. Lokesh this time deserves praise for his brilliance of setting the film in such a way that it is engaging throughout in one way or another. Action sequences and its choreography was top class and genuinely entertaining as well. Major acting performances from Kamal Hassan,Vijay Setupathi and Fahad Fasil is the base of the entire film. Moreover, the cameo with that mesmerizing BGM that teases to much more in the future felt like a cherry on top of a delicious cake.In the end, a top notch action movie in all aspectsRating:79/100.

Appreciate director lokesh to bring back a classical hit movie character of legendary actor Kamal Hasan to a new life in multi starrer movie. Vikram a retired undercover agent life turns suddenly and he must to do to save his grandson. Hats off to the director to pull a effective narrative and execution on screen with a legendary actor like Kamal Hassan. He seriously underplays in his portrayal with his brilliant performance. Ofcourse, Fahad Fasil given wonderful performance he carries first off the movie with his portrayal. Vijay sethupathi gives another brilliant performance for his portrayal. A must watch movie after long time.

Star studded. Must have been absolute blast of an experience for the fans watching it in a theatre. And why not the director has added every ingredient that can vibrate an average fan to feel the punch to perfection.Keeping aside the bgm, stunt scenes, the fact that there are three brilliant actors and the sound and graphics effects, what exactly is the core of the plot?Personally, there is nothing beyond the theatre experience to take home.

Versatile star Kamal Hassan is back with a BIG BANG. Thanks to the director, Lokesh Kanagaraj, the screenplay is very racy and interesting. Despite the running time, nearly 3 hours, the film is not lagging.The most interesting about VIKRAM is every single actor, small or big, has his / her moment.Music by Anirudh is scintillating.Apart from Kamal, other actors like Vijay Sethupathi, Fahad Fasil, Surya, Naren and others perform very well.Overall, everyone says the collection of the movie, worldwide, is setting new records.No doubt, VIKRAM will become a milestone in the history of Indian cinema.

Amazing amazing movie with a good script and superb acting which obviously a good movie requires at all times.Acting is outstanding and obviously not other than Kamal Hassan who proved that no matter what he does his job at best.Vijay sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil also did amazing role and all other supporting actor actresses were also great.Overall great movie to watch and enjoy.Some of the scenes were over, for example, in the last scene when the villain was announcing Kamal Hassan's bounty he was right there in the middle of the crowd and no one noticed him and he was not even in disguise

It's an ok movie, a decent one time watch.The Plus and the Hero:
Anirudh Carries the movie single handedly, making you visualize everything within his music. It's a masterpiece of a background score, and needs to be felt in Dolby.Review and the minus: Decent first half and plot build-up but looses it's way in the second. It's another movie which could have been great.It's hard to see how three intelligent actors in Kamal, Fahad and Sethupathi could have missed the plot in the second half, didn't they read the script?

What a comeback by Mr Kamal Haasan and the trio of Kamal, Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faazil has made this film a highly riveting thriller! Direction and screenplay from Lokesh Kanagaraj was too good, but there's too much violence and some of the scenes could have been better filmed, so that this film can suit kids too.Other two noteworthy characters are Kumaravel and Agent Tina, which was a surprise package! üëçBGM of Anirudh - probably this is his best score yet and BGM for Vijay Sethupathi introduction was giving goosebumps!Because of too much violence, this film is not suitable for family audience, otherwise it would have scored a PERFECT 10! üëç

Just another KGF inspired film that has no logic at all.... Vijay and Fahad were reasonable but Kamal... Decode the film scene wise and you'll realize there's sense only where there's no Hassan. Like many other South Indian old stars who are releasing films glorifying themselves this one is kamal's it seems.... Loved agent Tina though. That was a gig.... Overall an enjoyable flick for one time if you watch it wearing 3d glasses.... Avoid the intro dance-song if you are not a Kamal fan.. just a heads-up if you don't want to find yourself in deep sleep or coma... Over hyped by fans I'd say.... Cheers.

One of the best films that I watched! It was an exhilarating experience. Enthralled by Director Lokesh's visionary execution that offers a glimpse intk his own cinematic universe, Anirudh's BGM & the brilliant acting prowess of Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan, Fahadh Faasil, Vijay Setupathi and Suriya Sivakumar, the film portrays a dicredited and almost mythical ex black ops specialist trying to solve the murder of his son, in the backdrop of Drug menace - a tale in which another black ops specialist in his prime & a family loving pablo escobaresque drug kingpin get somehow involved.

It's all starting absurd and leading to a nowhere. Fahad role is absolutely new and brilliant to watch. The first half is fully ruled by him and few with VJS. The second half looks very week as there is no weight on scenes and just gunfires & killings in lots.However Kamal appeared in a few scenes - he is absolutely great in his performance.The individual character references and mannerisms are really good for Fahad and Gayathri VJS and that midget rouge Kamal and his team - Tina & santhana barathiNaraen character is wasted and did not add special value Dilli character reference was nice and logic miss for Adaikalam and his bro.Rolex is one useless character in the movie and Surya made no special performance. Anyone can walk out of a car and bunch one's head - that's nothing different a Tamil cinema villain did new. The same mannerism was followed from MGR, Jai Shankar, Rajini and Vijay period and Surya just followed the same act. I don't understand why the theatre and reviewers praising for Surya entry and performance..May be I m from another universe...After Master - I fully turned out to be a Loki fan and he is one step below Master now. Second half definitely needed a change but ended up very old fashioned...1st half very good and 2nd half average.. Definitely it's a positive response and review from me...No one can save the other.

Vikram- What a cracker of a movie.Lokesh as a director has raised the level in Indian cinema as close to Hollywood level; even movies crossing 1000 crores need to bow down to this masterpiece.Screenplay is racy and story is astoundingly good.Fahadh Faasil is terrific with laser sharp acting.Vijay Sethupathi is dangerously good and fulfills the role beyond imaginable.Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan is the central pillar and the spine of the movie. He shines as bright as the SUN with crazy angriness and subtle acting.Action sequences and BGM are top of the world.This movie easily goes down as one of the top gangsta and thriller movie of all time.This is how movies should be made so audience can relish it as a Michelin star food.

Big mistake and that this garbage should be rated so high speaks of loading and bias. I was conned, and I suspect a horde of supporters has been unleashed on this movie. 10 out of 10? Give me a break! An absurd plot with a large element of cute kitsch in the form of the sound averse baby, a pudgy hero with incredible martial arts skills, guns gangs drugs zillions of killings, a beheading or two. There are some production values in here, but just short of 3 hours of unending violence - way way overlength. It is hard to believe that the script writers could concoct such a long-winded stupid story. I watched it, all of it, getting increasingly angry as it dribbled on. Giving it 2/10 is generous.

What a movie! Firstly a big salute to Lokesh Kanagaraj sir for delivering masterpieces like Kaithi and Vikram. It's biggest x factor is Anirudh music. What a music, not in Tamil not in Hindi the music in background is in English. It's most of the scenes are full of goosebumps especially the interval fight scene. I liked the character of Vijay Sethupathi in that movie and damn man his character is just..... very good. But there is also a thing that it's VFX is not good, I mean that they are average and what could we talk about acting, the cast of the movie contains the best actors of India. Story is also very good and gripping but sometimes the movie felt stretched but overall it is a worth watch movie. There is some cuss words but they are muted and there is a brothel house scene which may not suitable for children.

Plot is ok. Acting is below average i guess. Kamal was just not fitting for the role. Cinematics of the movie are amazing. Sound design and everything enjoyable. Even side actors are somewhat justifying there role. And last entry of villain was so good. But Vikram as center of everything couldn't justify it's role. So many slow mo shots, which is fine.. but Kamal was just not the right person, it was clear that some scenes were played by stuntguy. Which is obvious. But just because Kamal was so unfit, it was evident. Lol. I think not all old superstar suits as lead/main action hero in movie like rajnikant does. Kamal should play roles where his age can be utilised.

This is a Highly Recommend Film. Finest Comeback for Kamal Hassan. Hats off to Lokesh Kanagaraj for utilising such a huge star cast and fulfills every expectations. Pure Lokesh Kanagaraj Film with hard core violence,Dark tone and Anirudh BGM and Songs are the USB of the Movie. Highly Recommended for People above 16+ due to Profanity and Regular Drug Use. Camera Rotation in Interval was never seen before in Indian Cinema and that Machine Gun Scene!!. Dilli Voice from behind and Suriya Cameo made whole theatre cheering and Screaming in my theatre in Delhi!! Prasanth Neel and Lokesh Kanagaraj has gained much trust in just a few films and are in the list of the Finest Filmmaker in India. Its bigger and larger on scale than KGF Chapter 2 and even have more Complex Story Line. Watch Kaithi(2019) before entering into the World of Vikram. So now it will be Rolex Vs Dilli Vs Vikram and Amar. Eagerly Waiting for Kaithi 2 and Vikram 2.

This movie is definitely the one to watch in theatres.Watching Kamal Hassan after 4 years on big screen is just magical and the performance he delivered is even more mesmerizing.At the age of 67 the fire he set on screen is just unbelievable.Vijay sethupathi is as usual in his best.Fahad Fazil runs the first half as he establishes story with engaging screenplay.Soundtrack by Anirudh is by far one of his best albums he ever given.Interval is just awe.Suriya cameo is another cherry at the top.And the very idea of Kamal Hassan, Suriya, Karthi sharing screen is just spine chilling.This movie is not just a regular flick or Kamal Hassan comeback movie.This is an origin story for the multiverse Lokesh Kanagaraj set in motion with a lot of potential.Cross-over, sequels, prequels, spin-off are all set in motion with this movie.As he develops the script he can add more superstars and more blockbuster films he can deliver with ease.This film series can most probably become the future of Kollywood action movies.Must must must watch in theatres.

The movie keeps us hooked for almost 3 hours, ending fight screen could have cut short ten minute, but end cameo's was worth watching, the movie is led by three heroes, with awesome characters perfection. It's worth watching for all three characters,

I think it's the quarter of South cinema... Pushpa,RRR,kgf2, and then there is Vikram! It's one of the best cinemas in recent times... Pure technical class! Script, direction.... Master class performances of Kamal Hassan, Vijay Sethupati and Fahad,Suryas cameo role! And the master blaster anirudh for his bgms, without which the scenes wouldn't have that sheen....

","<span class=""review-date"">1 August 2022</span>","
Till date I've watched the film more than 5-6 times, twice in theatres and rest on Disney+Hotstar and yet I'm not over this drug, the addiction level to this film is damn high! I guess I need to write a review about this film which will calm me down well!The moment I heard about this film my excitement level reached sky limits not only because it was a Kamal Hassan comeback film that too directed by my new favourite director Lokesh Kanagraj but also because the film also starred 2 of my favourite actors in India- Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi. I watched the trailer and that immediately intrigued me what the plot will be all about, hence I went to theatres without any friend of family member of mine and watched the movie with few people around as here in Hindi belt very few knew about Vikram releasing, all thanks to absolute garbage film Samrat Prithviraj taking over the screens. And I was blown away within few minutes of the film, it was literally a follow up to Loki's previous blockbuster Kaithi? Why was this kept a secret from the audience? Lokesh Kanagraj already established a cinematic verse with Kaithi and continued with Vikram yet no one knew about it? That was a complain I had but who cared in Hindi belt what was going on, I wished Vikram had same level of marketing that Baahubali series, RRR and KGF 2 had and same hype around audience in Mumbai.Plot: Within first few minutes of the film Kamal Hassan's character supposedly died and Fahadh Faasil starts his investigation around series of deaths and that keeps you hooked completely. I was blown away by the fact that Fahadh had dubbed for his own voice in Hindi, didn't know he spoke Hindi that well. Now I really hope to see him in some Bollywood film, not in side role but a lead role that'll justify his talent. As the story unfolds very little references to Kaithi was shown in the film, but the Hindi dubbing part pretty much annoyed me as in Kaithi they changed the characters' name from Bejoy to Arjun or Dili to Shiva but in Vikram they retained the OG names instead of dubbing them as well, why would those dubbing studios or dubbing directors do that!? They retained OG names from Kaithi in Vikram but decided to change Vijay Sethupathi's name from Sanhdanam to Chandan? Now in the future what am I supposed to call Karthi, Narain, Sethupathi Arjun Das or Harish Uthaman in future movies, their dubbed names or OG names? The continuity can't be blamed on Lokesh Kanagraj because it's fault with Hindi distributors how they ruin the fun. But that was easily avoided by first time viewers as no one had any idea about Kaithi in my theatre hence I took the enjoyment in the narrative, how the investigation unfolded, one by one every interesting character was introduced with Faasil leading the film from the front while Vijay Sethupathi seemed to be having a supporting role although his entry was whistle worthy, perhaps the best entry in the film unlike many heroes having lean or 6 pack abs shirtless entry, here the Makkal Selvan appeared bare body with flabs coming out and seemingly enjoyed the film like nobody else had done. That was the evil entry! And as the film reached interval point, VJS and FaFa were as excited and shocked as us audience when The Universal Hero appeared onscreen after a kickass action. And fro, that point Kamal Hassan took over the film and what followed was madness and mayhem presented by the mad genius Lokesh Kanagraj, how Vikram and his team fights out the drug cartel led by Chandan(VJS) with Amar(FaFa) joining the fight after taking a backseat.Performances: Before I get to the trinity of acting prowess I'd like to talk more about support cast. The one who stole the show with only one scene- Vasanthi as Agent Tina! The action she did, with fork knives spoons and tried her best to save Vikram's family was whistle worthy! That scene alone made me hoot for the film every time I watched it! Agent Tina was easily the best support character in this film. The very next best supporting role came from Maya S Krishnan as the escort. Those scenes were hilarious and brought the house down, well supported by Anirudh's BGM(I'll come to that part soon!) Chemban Vinod Jose did well as Police Chief who was surprisingly one of the antagonist of this film, besides other Agents, Chandan's men, Narain as Inspector Bejoy and other Vikram's team members did well as per their part with Jabir Sadiq emerging as another highlight due to the fear he brought in cutting leg, especially during Kamal Hassan time.Now I'll come to the lead performers- FaFa was the main man in first half. It became out and out Fahadh Faasil show in first half of Vikram and in some scenes even overshadowed the Ulaga Nayagan in his own film! He didn't have any quirks like VJS and Kamal Hassan did but stood tall in his performance leading the film well and kept us hook only through his acting. If anyone asks me who is the best actor of India in today's generation I won't say Ranbir, Ranveer, Vicky Kaushal or Ayushmann Khurrana, the name is one and only Fahadh Faasil! While FaFa lead the first half well, VJS brought the house down with his screen presence itself. Despite playing another villain he gave new dimension in his performance, this time the entry scene, his own take as contemporary hero till the villainous avatar took his place and the fear he showed humbled his character well enough which had too many shades and performer like VJS was surely gonna nail it! He's the Makkal Selvan The People's Own Treasure! Now I've talked about my favourite stars, let's talk about their favourite- The Universal Hero, The Ulaga Nayagan, The Kamal Hassan! He's 60+, almost 70 year old man and he was the Vikram he carried from his old film of same name, same character and same swag! Kamal Hassan in second half is what this film truly is all about! My dad and mom used to be big KH fans and I never had cared about him but after Vikram I'm eagerly dying to see his other films in Tamil as well, not just the old Hindi ones that I've watched. He's easily amongst the best actors in the world, imagine putting Al Pacino and Sylvester Stallone into one roll, yup that's who Kamal Hassan is! And while these 3 weren't enough, here comes the screaming cameo of Rolex Bhai, SURIYA! It was well teased earlier Suriya is going to have a cameo in this film, just not what I had expected! I thought it'll be some starry cameo or for the sake of audience, but instead it became an uproar of him playing the ultimate antagonist of Lokesh Cinematic Universe, bringing Kaithi and Vikram rolled into one big universe Lokesh Kanagraj created! If Ironman(Karthi as Dilli) is already in this mess, Captain America(Kamal Hassan) and Thor(FaFa) already dealt with Loki(VJS) than now they're ready to face the ultimate Thanos(Suriya) in the madness created by the Lokesh Kanagraj himself! Can't wait to see how the universe unfolds, especially the battle of brothers- Karthi vs Suriya!While the 3 pillars above are covered up well enough, we cannot forget the fourth pillar of this film- Aniruddh! The BGM provided for almost every character and every situation is as addictive as a drug and uplifts the film well! The Vikram remixed, VJS entry and fight scenes, Amar's own music, the Escort BGM(how smartly that was used needs unanimous hoots) and of course the Rolex Music as cherry on cake, amongst all of them Once Upon A Time There Lived A Ghost emerges as my favourite! I've made sure even my family watches this film again and again and they did, totally love it as hell! The scene in which KH FaFa and VJS were facing each other is easily amongst the best face off in Indian film industry ever! Just wished a proper face off between Amar and Chandan, but Vikram was enough for Chandan to face! Going with all 10 stars, only wished Hindi dubbing was as good if not better than RRR KGF films.

Vijay and Fahad showed their class throughout the movie and Kamal Hassan did what he does, act.Go watch it in the cinema with popcorn and have a good time.

Absolutely stunning movie and every one acted crazily and there is no need of special mention to Kamal Hasan.The action sequences and some scenes miss the logic but I would still watch it because there are movies in Telugu like RRR, Akanda and SVP who were hits for no reason. Those 3 movies have no logic, nothing just promotions promotions promotions where as Vikram was a silent killer.Can't wait for suriya in next part....,BGM of this movies is just crazy as nuts and anirud is india best music composer for sure.

An ensemble gangster - cop piece from the wood work,. You""ll find yourself within the throes of this neo noir racket of loud mouthed hunters, without redeeming qualities, empowered to kill using rusted firearm, saw, breakneck bare knuckle punches. Mr. Director here seemed to have gorged on Guy Ritchie and Tarantino style but least the same. Some scenes are extended, violent, and bloody that it could ghost 'Terminator'. No amendment to this racking slaughter house movie is absolute. I heard some one scream ""bang bang"" in the crowded cinema. Call it freedom of speech for a movie that is clueless, full of lopsided characters, so relentlessly terrible that I can't even muster the rage and exasperation. The interlinking events that eventually wrap together type of making a film seemed to have gone awry with a sordid cameo in the climax that fiercely pimp smacks you till you've lost count of what the heck this movie was about. Was it Frried Rice or Omega... anyone?

286,nickraman-27699," A punchy comeback & the start of cinematic universe.
","<span class=""review-date"">21 June 2022</span>","
Vikram can be termed as either a Kamal Haasan comeback or Kaithi 1.5, serving as an entry to Lokesh's Cinematic Universe.Vikram can also a spinoff of the original Vikram (1986) where gaps are filled in between the events of 1986 film and this story. It's
likely that in the development of this film, Kamal would have rendered an idea where post Agni Putra's episode in the 1986 film, Agent Vikram
is assigned to lead a Black Ops squad the following year (1987) consisting of squad members (Agent Lawrence, Agent Tina & Agent Uppili). The
squad was deemed successful for the Govt, up until 1991, where the squad experienced critical failure and had gone underground as a result
of that failure.What's interesting here is that Haasan takes a backseat in the film and lets Fahad Faasil drive with support from Vijay Sethupathi, Chemban Vindod and others. Faasil gets a solid role here and makes up for his one-note appearance from Velaikaaran, where I felt he was severely limited.As for Sethupathi, he was as good and on par with Haasan and Faasil. In fact, would rate this far better than his recent performances, where I felt he was just sleepwalking through his earlier roles. As a film, Vikram is far better than Kanagaraj's Master, where I felt the compromise between a Vijay film and a Lokesh film tilted more towards the former.Any blemishes? The blood and gore in the film won't be to everyone's liking. However, if you can relish the blood and gore from the KGF duology (specifically Chapter 2)
, you'll love this movie. Also, that Suriya cameo was just awesome.Another criticism is the Pan India Marketing. This is still an issue with Tamil films projecting themselves as Pan India but unlike Rajamouli's RRR or Neel's KGF, Vikram had only Kamal to do the promotions across North India to get the Hindi version across. The result? Not so earth shattering collections in the Hindi belt, yet thanks to the hindi version being sold for under 3C, the collection is double/thrice that, so it's still a profit thanks to the word of mouth. But this promotional works for Pan India needs to be worked on from the Tamil Industry.Coming back to Kamal's return with this Vikram; Hope he realizes what the paying public has been missing all along while he's been delaying or
shelving projects, doing needless reality TV show anchoring (Bigg Boss Tamil) and above all, Politics.PS: Please watch Kaithi before watching Vikram.

Producers/directors have created an interesting comic book style action universe that feels so much better due to the great acting, that smooths out a sub-par script with over the top sequences.Right on top, scoring the best is the great music - soundtracks and high energy bass, blending well with the stylish movie that it is.Definitely recommend one watch, if not more. Interested in sequels, the story carries potential.Will it break from being just another vigilante-revenge-action hero? Not in this one, but if it doesn't in the next one - it would be a disservice to the ambition of the project.Vikram can also be counted among the Indian movies this year that give Marvel/DC style movie making a run for their money.

I am so impressed with this movie on so many levels. Not only does it look absolutely stylish with cinematography and lighting that brings the noir look of the new Batman movies while being distinct on its own, not only does it start the possibilities of a cinematic universe in Tamil cinema which is extremely brave bold and new, not only does it have some of the best work of Kamal, Fahaad Faasil, Vijay Sethupathi, and a surprise cameo that is sure to shock audiences, not only does it have action set pieces that are absolutely world class and have a grit and effect of a Hong Kong film, but it manages to do all that in service to an amazing story and screenplay and Lokesh Kanagraj's excellent directorial execution of that story
It's a must watch theater experience especially in India and it is definitely worthy of a 10/10After Vikram Vedha I think this is the movie that will change Tamil cinema for the better and challenged the perception of what a Pan India film should be and possibly touch heights not reached by other filmsHats off to the entire team y'all did amazing and I hope to see more movies like this.

I solely went to watch this flick because of all the hype, mostly surrounding Lokesh and it's a Kamal Hasan film, which we hadn't experienced for a long time! The Director seem to have built a cult fandom for himself with just 4 movies under his belt which says a lot. I personally have only watched Master prior to this and didn't see anything new in it. In fact I found the movie to be very forgettable. It's mostly just another Vijay masala flick for Vijay fanboys. No offence but that's just how it is.I went into Vikram with mild expectations but boy was I surprised. With this movie, I can confidently say that Lokesh has finally found his own style. I will point out the pros real quick because I only want to elaborate on the cons.Pros:
1) Score by Anirudh (truly astounding!)
2) Cinematography
3) Fight Choreography (especially the robot camera scenes. I really hadn't seen such camera moves even in Hollywood so kudos to the Stunt and Camera Team!)
4) Sethupathy's Acting - The character could been very generic but the actor realised his role very well.5) Violence(Very bloody and intense scenes which I found to be a very ballsy decision by the director to go full on nuts!)
6) Character twists(the reveals with title cards if you know what I mean)
7) Final Boss Reveal(*watchbrand*)Cons:
1) Extended Runtime: 15 - 20 mins could have been taken out with tighter editing cause I could really feel the Runtime at certain places.2) Related to Kaithi: Yes, I know that Lokesh is trying to build his own MCU but the connection to Kaithi felt really Convoluted and unnecessary to the main plot. The beach scene, the theatre kidnap scene and many more didn't make much sense. I wish the story just stuck to Amar investigating about Vikram's suspicious death and him learning about the link between Sandhanam and Vikram.3) Bejoy: This is also related to my previous point. The Director fails to communicate who this guy is and why he is so important to THIS MOVIE. I also found his whole speech in jail to be cringeworthy and pretentious.4) Dumb Character Decisions:a) Why dafuq did Amar decide to blow up Sandhanam's house? Isn't he supposed to be a good guy? I mean if you really want to catch Sandhanam by the balls, you only go after him and his business. Blowing up his whole frikin house would make you a criminal. I mean there are like 30-40 people living in that house including innocent children!!!!! I lost all sympathy and support for Amar when he made this dumb decision! Also, the movie doesn't really shows us how exactly did his team placed the explosives without anyone knowing lmfao!!B) When time is of the essence, why on earth would you run barefoot to a location where your girlfriend is being held captive to be possibly killed !??? Taking an Auto would have saved him so much time. He could have probably prevented an unnecessary death.C) Very early on, we understand that Vikram's grandchild is intolerable to loud noises, which could possibly kill him. In the climax, when there is literally a war going on, I don't really think the ANC headphones would have protected the Baby's ears. I mean just the sound from the minigun would have killed the baby !!!In the end, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who's looking for some good R rated action but it could have been so much better with a more refined script and shorter runtime for it to be really memorable in the long run.Note: Forgive by English as I ain't a native speaker.Review by RPJP.

This movie is one of the best South Indian action movie of all time if I watch it again it still give me goosebumps KGF and RRR are also great movies but this movie was something else that can't be explained in words. When I first saw this I think that it would not be better than KGF but as I start watching it it blew my mind it changed my opinion and introduction of rolex in ending was second best villain introduction of all time for me first was The Joker from The Dark Knight 2008 and Chandan was also a great character in my opinion so much excited for next part I hope it will be more great than part 1 good luck for next part.

The story is about some undercover agents of a formerly active government organization declaring war on drug mafias and greedy government officials including a government minister.Although a bit more violent it justifies its genre of a crime thriller. Vijay Sethupathy, Kamal Hassan, and my favorite Fahaadh Faasil give you a typical south Indian experience with the quality story,bgm, and action.Cameo of Suriya gives hint to the sequel.

Vikram .. (review) Aarambikalama... if it's Petta for Karthik SubbaRAJ, it would be Vikram for Lokesh KanagaRAJ. Magical reels by the fanboys of the stars. The movie Vikram is like that of a Sirius Star (brightest star in night sky) in the world of movies not just for LK but also for Kamalhassan who at this age still continues to prove he's the best of all . The story is so very detailed that slowly we get immersed into the movie and start travelling along with the stars not wanting for an end any sooner . LK with this solid storyline ensures almost a flawless screenplay making every scene interesting and not to be missed. It's definitely a great success for LK to get a star like Kamalhassan to adapt to the need and rather not to tamper the story to adapt to the star value . And big big thanks to aandavar to listen to the needs of the director and delivering the best . He is the biggest actor , he is the biggest producer and this is the biggest national movie (KGF - Kamal's Grand Film) . And yes beyond Kamalhassan , we have some relatively bigger names like the seasoned actor Vijay Sethupathi, the very natural and a brilliant actor of all times Fahad Faasil , the man with Bass voice Arjun Das , Kalidas Jayaram , Naren, Shivani , Gayathri , Chemban Vinod Jose, Santhanabarathi and Surya towards the end of movie predominantly aimed for the next part. Agent Tina by Vasanthi is awesomatic and a total surprise. The movie was like a World of War, something we would have seen in Hollywood with so much of arms and ammunitions lighting up the movie screen and Anirudh blasting the speakers with his amazing BGM and Title / Pathala song. He is like this small sized bomb by look but when ignited delivers a thunderous output . The in-depth study on the props and sets put up by the art directors needs a mention here . Very realistic . Hard punches by stunt master Anbarivu Is bloodysome. Lokesh is like Poda Andha Aandavarae Namba Pakkam .

The highlight of the movie is the star cast with hype around lokesh universe the movie had all the hype. Coming to the story it is a below average revenge yet not a revenge story. Usp being the linkage to lcu and good action sequences or it would have been an average affair. The screenplay lags around the second half.On the performances kamal hassan is top notch
Fahad is a treat. Vijay sethupathis charecter is half cooked but he tries to salvage it though it didnt work for me i didnt see the heart in it, (felt it was the same charecter of rowdy doctor from soodu kavum) it is one time watchhhhh.

Was an absolute treat to watch aandavar at his full form. Fahad has a lion's share of screen time and he nails it pretty hard. Vijay sethupathy's villain is cool and it's just the beginning of a huge badass behind. Loved it to the core.

""Vikram"" demands your attention. It is not just a regular action movie, you need to pay close attention to the various details as these are important to understand the film.This is probably the factor that made me give a 10 instead of a 9. It was a more complex story than ""Kaithi"" (the first movie of the Lokiverse), interesting and unpredictable screenplay, which elevates the way the story is being told.Kamal Haasan was of course brilliant. But I was particularly impressed with FaFa, who almost stole the show, in spite of Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan present in the film. Vijay Sethupathi carried his character and incorporated quirky mannerisms which worked for the film. Direction by Lokesh was brilliant and original. The cinematography was great, especially in all the fight and chase scenes at night. Also, this is probably the best score I have ever heard from Anirudh. He is in the form of his life when it comes to massy BGM. The BGM perfectly complemented every scene and to the overall tone of the film. The BGM is among the best of this year.I did ignore some flaws of the film and dubbing issues, just because the movie was super engaging and fun to watch. I would give this a 10/10!

What a PHENONEMAL film from Lokesh Kanagaraj!The effort that has gone into writing 'Vikram' is commendable! Casting 3 huge stars such as Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathy & Fahadh Faasil is not a tiny feat, but Lokesh has provided equal screen space to all 3 actors, which is a BRILLIANT feat!The screenplay was thoroughly engaging & the film didn't feel boring at any moment. The first half had a slow pace, but the second half had a brisk pace. 'Vikram' has a lot of goosebump-inducing scenes & I'd be shocked if someone came out of the theater without screaming their lungs out!This film was a technical masterpiece! The background score by Anirudh was TERRIFIC! It was undoubtedly one of Anirudh's finest works! The cinematography by Girish Gangadharan was world-class & especially those Cam Robot movies were out-of-the-world! The action choreography by Anbu Arivu was among the best Tamil Cinema has ever witnessed! 'Vikram' is undoubtedly a world-class action movie on par with Hollywood's finest üí™üèº!Last but not least, Ulaganayagan Kamal Hassan was an absolute BEAST in this flick! His energy levels were through the roof & the man was oozing style & swag throughout the film! Fahadh Faasil & Vijay Sethupathy delivered Stellar Performances as expected! Both of them proved that why their one of the best scores of Indian Cinema once again!Overall, 'Vikram' is one of the best movies I've seen in 2022 & it is certainly one of the best movies Tamil Cinema has produced! Tollywood has Rajamouli, Sandalwood has Prashanth Neel & we have Lokesh Kanagaraj! Hats off to Lokesh for this magnificent work titled 'Vikram'!

If you are a Kamal fan, you can watch, If you are VJS fan you can watch it, If you are FaFa fan you can watch it, If you are a Lokesh Kanagaraj fan you can watch it, If you are a Suriya fan you can watch it. I think everyone will fall atleast in one of these. Jokes Apart, the film was a good theatrical experience. It had a lot of goosebumps moments. Some notable moments were VJS intro scene which was class as well as had a lot of humour in it (I could see the whole theatre laughing), Interval block, FaFa saving the chil, Agent Tina fight scene, Suriya intro scene. Also the scene that takes place in San Franciso reminded me bit of Dark knight rises scene (But it cannot match the original). Almost all characters are still in my mind which means the characters were well written. But it thought the screenplay was bit laging in first half but it takes a surge from interval. Also VJS character was not that well written and it had nothing unique but VJS by his phenomenol acting and humour aced it. Kamal sir no words, FaFa no words. If you want a good theatrical experience you should watch it. Also it is important to note the fact that Lokesh somehow tried to connect Kaithi and Vikram and bound them into a Universe. I dont know if it has scope, but the last few scenes raised my respect towards Lokesh as a writer even though screenplay is not that engaging. Also the scene in which Kamal explains about drugs and its side effects deserve a mention. Overall, watch it atleast once, if you think you didnt understand it watch it twice.

It's great to see non-commercial movies booming recently, thanks to the audience for choosing such movies & the directors like LK showcasing the best of the Indian Cinema.Vikram, is a tamil Action Adventurer Thriller that focuses on the post Kaithi events (yes ! It's a Lokesh Kanagaraj Universe) where the drug dealing between the government officials & mafias continue to raise stakes.New characters being introduced. Some plotholes clear doubts that exist in Kaithi. Cinematography is top notch. Camera work in the action scenes feel like they're inspired from hollywood project Upgrade ! It's overall a masterpiece from a South Indian box office. The bgm score from Anirudh really hits you hard (Although it still needs some tweaking).The reason I gave rating of 3 notches down, is :
1. It still depends on the star cast to pull mass audience into theatres.2. The amount of gore is so ample with restricted censor rating & not recommended for young teens & to be seen with a family.3. Dubbing into other languages like Hindi haven't taken much care & promotion over PAN India is very poor.

The story started with a very interesting idea of Kamal being dead and ""Amar"" finding out the motive of the black mask people but it lacks in comedy but they tried it.The second half of the movie was almost just violence. The story kinda sounded like any regular movies which is that the black squad is trying to stop people for drugs usage which I feel like can be seen in most of the stories. But if I had to say the positives it would be the bgm, actors acting and the Rolex entry was alright but the best is the hot chick in the movie (the xxx lady)

I decided to watch the movie on hotstar given its rating of 8.8 on IMDb but 30minutes into the movie and I understood the ratings cannot be trusted anymore. It's not a pathetic movie by any stretch but it's more like a 6/6.5 rated movie.The good bits for me are Vijay and Fahadh. These two can act, for me Kamal Hassan was a bit over the top. Every time ether Vijay Sethupathi or Fahad Fasil come on screen they demand your complete attention. Watch this movie for them. The story is shaky at best. The westernised sound track to give a wow factor seems a big miss for me as well! If you had 2.5hours and it's rainy and gloomy outside and you can't do anything else watch this movie.

""Once upon a time there lived a Ghost""
An outstanding Movie with a well penned script filled with a tons of action along with suspense & a lots of thrill.Lokesh Kanagaraj has created a great masterpiece. At the very beginning,movie goes so simply until the real plot comes in the scene. Drug cartels,corruption & masked murderers, the entire film is set in underworld. Kamal Hassan as Vikram is truly a Ghost like character,Vijay Sethupathi as Chandan/Sandhanam is just mind-blowing you can feel comedic as well as insane in same character & Fahadh Faasil as Agent Amar is so unpredictable, his way of solving the mysteries behind masked murderers is great. No doubt that the casting is absolutey superb. Four Top Class actors in a single movie is like a perfect Dum Biryani(Lokesh Fans will understand). The storyline is filled with so much intense suspense & one can't predict what will happen next. You can't miss even a single scene the story makes audiences to stick their eyes to screen.Cinematography is so dark & subtle. The camera angles were quite impressive,it made the action scenes more awesome. Every scene is shot very precisely. Aniruddh's music & bgm took the whole movie to a different level. The music & bgm gives justice to each & every scene. Movie has a great badass bgm which makes action scenes more entertaining & truly 'Badass'. But before watching Vikram do watch KAITHI which suprisingly serves as prequel to it. Most of the characters are linked to Kaithi. With this movie director Lokesh Kanagaraj has given birth to an action packed multiverse.At the end, a surprise cameo will completely blow your mind & will make you more excited. This characters brutal entry creates a terrific bang. Dont miss the end.""The End Is Beginning""

In short, An action showreel had aspirations to become a movie.

I watched 12 th june, after 11 th day of release. I was gone to watch the movie with lot of Expectectations bcz the movie is already hit and praised with good reviews. But right from the start there is no logic in screenplay and story especially in First half of kamal's scenes narration. It's very stupid and I don't know why kamal's character was narrated as drunkard and womenizer. Lokesh only think night scenes make the story quite interesting. But it only worked in maanagaram and kaithi. In master and vikram it's not working. Lokesh needs to work more on his story and screenplay. In master and vikram too bad in both dept. But he succeeded in both movies with star value only. I really wonder how kamal agreed to do this movie with this story and screenplay. I only say kamal and lokesh rided on their luck that the movie got this kind of blockbuster. But not really worth for this kind of hit or fame.

Kamal Hassan is the suprise of the movie he goes through emotional to action mode through the film. Fahad is as usual the vackbon of the film. He nearly outshines Kamal Hassan in first half. Vijay sethupathi character is interesting and full of complexity which actor 0lays effortlessly. Meanwhile agent tina is the sudden suprise for audience.The main carrying factor for this 3 hrs movie is Anirudh music. It's seems like he wakes up with new bgm every morning.Last suriya is the boss's. YESSS SIIRRR OK SIRRRR JUST SIIRRRRR.

Funny Action Sequences in quite some scenes. The story is kinda predictable after some point and Editing should have been better. There were some some lag scenes which could have been cut to make the watching experience more enjoyable with a crisp screenplay. Some elevations just don't work. I mean not everyone can be like director Prashant Neel or actors like Prithviraj or Mohanlal.Having said all of this, the acting department especially by Kamal Hasan and Vjay Sethupathi are the biggest strengths of the film. They carry the whole movie where ever there are deficiencies in other departments. The film is a quite entertaining mafia masala one. Watch it if you have time.

","<span class=""review-date"">4 June 2022</span>","
First of all kudos to Lokesh for giving equal importance to all the three Stars in a Multistarrer movie. With having a Biggie like Kamal Hassan, Loki managed to give equal character importance for FaFa and VJS. Movie starts with FaFa as a Team Head of a Shadow organization assigned to investigate a seriel killings, which leads him to Connect with VJS and Kamal. First half was an investigation thriller which Loki written and narrated in a most Stunning way. It's happening in a Crime World and Loki wrote an exceptional first Half to explore the Story of this world and it's dark secrets. I was blown away by the first half, it was too amazing.. even though it is predictable in the midway still it kept me engaging throughout the first half with a Bang! Intermission sequence.And starts the second half.. when the First Half over with it's investigation and the big reveal.. second half went on full gun blazing action mode. The latter half is filled with lots of guns, lots of deaths, lots of blast and lots and lots of actions. It was an amazing theatre experience. KH, FaFa, VJS this trio proved their worth in an extravagant action movie. Other than them even the other characters like Narine, Chemban Vinod got their own importance for them. That's what I liked very in loki's writting.. not giving all the Grace to the main Lead and Making other characters dumb.. that was happens in big Star movies but here the Director/Writer managed to break that stereotype, he gave all the goosebumps moments to Kamal Hassan and also gave the other Stunning moments to FaFa and VJS equally. Infact Kamal allowed FaFa and VJS to dominate the first half and he arrives at the interval and the steals the moment.The problem I found was with an exception first half writing the second half Only has Guns and actions. The whole story is explored in the first half itself.. so the latter has guns , blast , guns , blast and again guns and blast.. Loki gave dozens of gun varieties to the actors and let them to go and play with it. That's what i found as a drawback.. may be he should have wrote something more in the second half. But those actions made you forgot About the drawbacks and the connect between Kaidhi and This will not at all make you feel about any drawbacks.And I found Suriya's Cameo as very ordinary and Cliched. Infact It looked like Kokki Kumar's entry in 'Vai Raja Vai' , in Lokesh Kanagaraj's Version. Nothing impactful. Overall VIKRAM lived upto it's Expectations and the buzz it created. An outstanding raw action movie from Kollywood. Loved it very much. Looking forward to 'Lokiverse'.

Hats off to Lokesh Kanagraj to introduce us to the world of his thriller universe. Kaithi was too good but here in Vikram he outshines himself as a director. First half was the investigation led by Fahad Fasil and his team then The interval bang with Kamal Hasan Sir, and the cliamx. This is how you make a proper blockbuster thriller movie. Waiting for part 2, last want to mention that please watch Kaithi so that you can find the link between Vikram and Kaithi.

This is my first review in IMDB. All these days I watched thousand of movies but was lazy enough to create an IMDB id to type a review. But I really wanted to write a review for 'Vikram' because it completely deserves this.This movie is so good that you would want to write a review to THANK the Director, Actors, Music Director and all the associated staff involved in the creation of this masterpiece.The way the characters are build, the way the Big stars of South Indian Movie Industry have been handled is Exceptional. The movie is gripping, stylish, suspenseful and unending. Kudos to The director, Lokesh Kanagaraj, who brought out the best performances from every single actor in the movie. A great comeback movie for Kamal Haasan, another feather in the cap for Fahad Faasil announcing his entry in Tamil movie industry, and Vijay Sethupathi just continues to prove why he must be considered as one of the finest actors in the country. The music by Anirudh will ring in your ears long after you would have watched the movie. Action sequences are raw and masterfully executed. This is that kind of a movie which you would really not want to end.I can't complete my review without mentioning about Rolex 'Sir'. In recent years, I don't remember seeing any special appearance as impactful as that of Surya. All in all a must watch movie not just for Lokesh or Kamal fans but for any movie lover. You just can't miss this Best movie of the year! Watch it and Thank me later.

I watched this movie after having so many positive reviews online and offline. I would say its a well made film for the legend Kamal Hassan where you won't miss action sequences despite his age by cleverly utilizing stunt actors replace him wearing black outfits which blends with the story.Keep expectations low and you won't be disappointed, it feels little lengthy although it won't bore you.Its a pure story driven no unnecessary jokes/characters.A one time watch for sure.

Interesting but very predictable storyline, with a lot of loopholes .Good action scenes, a blend of Expendables, Equalizer, and other such such Hollywood flicks are spoiled by unnecessary loud background music, which dilutes the intensity.The editing could have been better. Nothing much in the cinematography department.Sethupathy does a wonderful job in his role. So does Fahaad. Kamalahasan doesn't have much scope to show his acting skills. The two women in the film have nothing much to do, not even a song dance scene.As with most Indian films, this is also an over ambitious effort, trying to do too much at one go.

","<span class=""review-date"">21 June 2022</span>","
This movie tries to be over-ambitious in its plot and execution and due to that, we are left with an over-complicated first half. However, Lokesh tries his best to untangle the mystery and explain everything later into the movie.I felt first half can be further trimmed down and the movie felt meandering here and there with no proper aim. The action pieces are great and all the actors have given their best performances.The Surya portion should have been kept in the dark before the release so the audience will be caught off gaurd and led to further rave reviews for this movie. Somewhere, the promotional team failed to contain this spoiler.I am excited now for Surya-Karthi face off in next part and the role Vikram plays in that.

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards Lokesh & team for this fantabulous action flick.The film starts off with a shocker which I will not reveal here but the first 15 minutes of the film itself made me realise that it's an edge of the seat Action/Thriller/Drama film and that's how I've always wanted to watch an action flick, it has to be interesting, engaging and fun at the same time, Vikram was all of those things to me.Although the first half was slightly slow paced, the second half quickly paced up and got into the action in no time. The director was aware of what he was getting himself into, he knew how to make an action flick. Vikram, Kaithi & Master and evidences for that.The action sequences were beautifully choreographed, the visuals were fantabulous like the rest of his films, performances of every single character was perfect, amazing screen time for every actor on screen.Positives:*Performances*

376,thepranavbiju," VIKRAM - a Loki magic dedicated to the ""godfather"" of Indian Cinema ""Aandavar"" Kamal Hassan!
","<span class=""review-date"">3 June 2022</span>","
Three cheers to team Vikram!!!Helmed my Kollywood's present-day ""master"" of gangster films - Lokesh Kanagaraj - and starring a surprise-filled ensemble cast, 'VIKRAM' surpasses the director's previous flick by multiple notches and proves to be a limitlessly goosebump-giving re-entry for ""Aandavar"" Kamal Hassan! Other than the superstar, my favourite in the film is definitely the ever-reliable Fahadh Faasil ""FaFa"" in yet another of his neat performances.The film interestingly happens in the same universe as Loki's Kaithi (2019) with a handful of characters (plus references) being reprised from the same. Lokesh cleverly incorporates his trademarks - a truck chase, a shot featuring Biryani, a heavy action scene in a factory and a reuse of the Browning machine gun scene featured in 'Kaithi' (a segment featuring the same gun was seen in the recent 'KGF Chapter 2') to top it - into the screenplay that isn't fresh but is thoroughly entertaining. A high-voltage action scene set in the house of ""Vikram"" would be my takeaway; no one saw that coming!Technically, 'Vikram' is easily elevated by Girish Gangadharan's brilliant cinematography. Philomin Raj's cuts are fine, even when the film looks tad too long at 177 minutes. This is the fourth musical by Anirudh Ravichander in three months and his graph touches the sky as he surpasses himself - 'Vikram' gives your ears an extravaganza that is easily top-notch compared to 'Beast', 'KRK' or 'Don'.'Vikram' is a film where you have to find ample time, book a ticket(s) in a theatre with the best audio and video services and have a great time celebrating. Fans of Ulaganayagan mustn't miss the theatre experience!

","<span class=""review-date"">13 June 2022</span>","
One of the most anticipated collaborations is finally here! A collaboration of a star like Kamal Haasan and a visionary director like Lokesh. Vikram is here and my god it is worth your money. This is a reminder that Lokesh is one of the best Indian directors. I would love to say why this film is great and why some things were somewhat meh. Actually pretty less meh.The things I thought was very tiresome.You have to probably do some homework(not school homework) before stepping into this film as it has many callbacks to Kamal's and Lokesh's filmography. This isn't a bad thing but I just mentioned it as it is tiresome for some casual moviegoers to do homework for a film.The Best things.Anirudh's music is the best thing about the movie. His music especially Once upon a time and the Title track is really captivating. Pathala Pathala works as the best kuthu number. The Pablo Escobar song is my favourite among all. The cinematography by the national award winning- Girish Gangadharan is top notch. Some shots during the set pieces are breathtaking. Anbariv's stunts are great and maybe the best work done by them. The performances are great. Kamal Haasan is great as usual but it is during the action set pieces that he unleashes the beast inside him and makes us root and cheer for the character. VJS has an interesting character as it is written a little bad but he adds some nuances to his character in each frame that makes an ordinary sequence featuring the character interesting which makes his character a terrifying villain but least terrifying than that of Master. Fahad Faasil is the hero in the first half and the sharpness and agile body language of Amar is well portrayed. He speaks with his eyes as he does most of the time he matches up to a legend like Kamal Haasan. Eyes that speaks most which tells that he is one of the best actors in India and needs an award right now. Surya is just raw and great in his special appearance. I would just pray Agent Tina gets a spinoff show or movie. The last but not least it is a pakka Lokesh padam. He is the best. His world building is top notch and how he manages to trick us with some incoherent sequences in the first half and revealing that the incoherence also had some purpose later on. It is called clever filmmaking. It is worth the watch for Lokesh's filmmaking alone.If you love Lokesh's type of filmmaking and Kamal Haasan, Vikram is a must watch for every aspects or should I say everything.

This is how an commercial movie should be. The storywriting is splendid in this movie. Kamalhaasan rocks in this commercial. Each character written in this movie has equal spaces. Fahadfaasil and Vijaysethupathi,both delivers their asusual stellar performances effortlessly. Kudos to Lokeshkanagraj for giving space to everyone in this movie and to kamalhaasan sir for accepting this. Anirudh's top class background score helps to lift the movie very high and this will be one of his best in his career.Overall the movie is too Good and well written and directed. Watch it without considering few logical elements in it as it was a commercial one,you can't expect natural elements in it. Top Notch performances of the cast and screenplay will keep you engaged thoroughly. DON'T MISS IT!!

Vikram one of the best and the biggest blockbuster movies released in 2022 kamal hassan Sir, vijay sethupathi sir and fahad fassil sir's acting was fantastic all the other characters had also got a great role and performed very well the story was engaging and the screenplay was very racy and lagless the narrative style of lokesh sir was great and his direction was amazing other than this the technical team of the film including cinematographer girish gangadharan sir editor philomeon raj sir stunt cherographers anbarivu had done there part astoushingly the stunt sequences were the goosbump moments anirudh ravichandran sir's music is the major plus of the movie which entirely elevated each and every scene and at last but not the least the last 6 minutes cameo by suriya sir as rolex was really a great moment in the movie his performance really oversheded the performances of the trio( kamal sir, fahad sir and vijay sethupathi sir ) on the whole vikram is purely a lokesh kanakaraj sir sambavam üòéüòéüòéüòéüòé

","<span class=""review-date"">3 June 2022</span>","
This movie is outstanding in every single field with remarkable results. I had very high expectations mind you, and this movie even shattered that expectations in another level. Lokesh Kanagaraj has handled this movie beautifully without any hiccups in screenplay or writing. In acting, all the actors play their part really well ! Especially the main characters !! Even though Vijay sethupathys acting is really good I felt he like he had the lesser amount of screen time in the main 3 characters but still packed a punch in every scene he got. Coming to music, DUDE its so good ! Anirudh killed this album with the variety of the themes. And also considering the humongous amount of movies has to work on Anirudh is a freaking genius. And also the cinematograph, I have no words. It looks really good and there's these fight scenes which are shot by robotic arms which looked very slick. I saw some public review which said Kamal Hassan didn't have enough screen time and stuff. But no the movie is balanced out perfectly sharing screen time. This movie is really well made and a must watch in the cinemas ! Hope everyone enjoys this movie as I did !!RATING : 8.7/10.

It's an multistarer movie directed by Lokesh kanagaraj. Kamalhasan as vikram , fahadh fasil as amar , vijay sethupathi as Santhanam and finally our one and onely Surya made a cameo in last 5 minutes as ROLEX with a 2nd part lead. In starting scene vikram and his son and one police cop was killed by some masked people's and amar the raw undercover agent was appointed for find out the masked people's and finally he find out who is those people's and what happened to them. That time Director put a interval and finally second half contains full-fledged action packed vikram the one man show. The director merged his old movie Kaithi which had a lead role of karthi as dilli both movie will merged together and get a new movie with a multistarer performance. People's called the whole things as LCU Lokesh Cinematic Universe.

Spy thrillers are rare in Tamil. This film has brilliant writing, spectacular performance, the action blocks were a blast and to top it all, the soundtrack was a killer. Kamal was impeccable as Ghost/Vikram. Fahad was phenomenal and VJS was superb. This film builds on to the Loki universe and one can't wait to see more of it.

I watched with the expectations that this will be an engaging thriller with very limited action scenes. This just turned out to be all out, over the top, action movie. All the action Kamal Hassan is doing is hard to believe and related to, especially with his present physique. It is soo apparent that it was all done by a body double.Story is good but action could have been reduced by a lot.

I feel so pity about bollywood when i saw these great movies are made only in south. I think they don't have that much hunger now.

398,architectddeepika," Warning Trigger Vikram Alert
","<span class=""review-date"">5 June 2022</span>","
WARNING-Trigger-Alert: The below review consists of statements which shares disturbing content that includes topics such as violence, blood-shed, physical abuse etc.""In the extremely competitive thick forest, I repeat, that the lion, tiger and leopard have won audiences with their performances which seems to be challenging each other.""Packing the first 30 minutes with huge blocks of perplexing data was kind of an overloading visual play, which was quite difficult to process. As and when you start to waver, or try to clasp the events that unfold, that s when these three legends attempt to give you the hang of it, until the fast pace settles down in an understandable track, in such a hypnotic way that gets you addicted and you cannot tear your eyes off them.This movie is a rapid racer script, sprinkled with intermittent goosebump moments. To ease off the high pressure, steam & tension, the light hearted humorous moments gives the audience, a much-needed break.There are so many shocking twists & implausible turns in this crime-drenched plot which brands ""Vikram"" so intriguing & electrifying to watch. I don't want to reveal anything because I felt that being one among the audience who thoroughly enjoyed the look, feel & make of this movie, selfishly desire that the person reading this should also experience that joy, as their very own to relish. I personally saw some people among the audiences, wherein their jaw literally dropped, or people covering their eyes/mouths to escape shock.The flabbergasted cinematography by Girish Gangadharan (myself a big fan of him) literally made the plot move swiftly with sundry startling directions that were shot so gorgeously, so mesmerizing, adding the picture-perfect colour to the bloated amount of grisliness. Thank you, sir, for manufacturing some blood-spattered gory scenes into dullness, because if I saw those in it's true light it's definitely going to be hard time forgetting it.Here s the punch:I felt that the cinematic barging violence was a bit too strong, bringing out the continuous repertoire of explosions (my heart burst), chases (my heart raced), gunfights, fire blasts (my eyes flamed in their light), screaming bullets (my ears were ringing), hyper-heroic acts, horrendous stunt scenes, made my head spin, dizzy with adrenaline, I was staring in disgust and had jerky moments with all the surprise attack bloodshed, fleshy bloody scenes which I don't want to see again, it would undeniably make my flesh crawl. I experienced a different type of horror and I feel ""The Ghost"" had done its job so well. I wouldn't say that the movie is devoid of it 's flaws, here and there you may feel inky bits of boredom, that's because it was too overwhelming for the mind to watch.Kamal Hassan: Long wait - 4 years, Mr. Nice Guy, after a long break, he s back in business! He who knows the tricks of the trade, knows what he wants, knows what to telecast, has flashed his flairs yet again with his ""Andavar"" act. Words fail me when I think of the hard work that he has put forth, considering his delicate aging body for the success of this movie. KH is fab, he's fickle, he's funny, he's sensitive, yet so unpredictably manly in everything that he does, moves his lips to talk, the movie 's got all of these tough-to-get emotions rolling.Vijay Sethupathi: I have never ever, looked down upon this man, his tremendously scaling high levels of acting skills which seems to have grown more abundantly like his heavy stature too. But the man really made up for his weight in such a way, that you wouldn't care much really. The audience and me fairly think that he would no longer shine as a hero because the villainous looks fit the terror scary bill, the anti-hero who readily shows no mercy, wicked looks suit him quite comfortably, am sure that these thoughts crossed the actor 's mind too.Fahadh Faasil: FA FA 's screen presence is quite emotionally remarkable, not to miss out on his plain clothes masquerading the cop that he really is, who dedicates joy in solving hazardous clandestine operations, whose only ambition is to keep feeding his virtuoso life pursuit of being an impossible genius cop.Narain: A fine actor in the making, who gave a decent, mature act. His fleeting screen moments were enough to subdue, in contrast to what he could easily pull off in the 2019 blockbuster ""Kaithi"".Anirudh Ravichander: The most celebrated music director of the recent times, never forgets to give his all, making it tall, his notes far rising more than the other 's beats. His ""Pathala Pathala"" song is literally not enough for the jig. His lilting background music, title song adds spice to the already hotter meal.Lokesh Kanagaraj: Fan-boy has made up his mind to prove himself with his dazzling writing, screenplay portraying the world-legend and has carved a niche in this multi-universe that he has created on his own within the cinema circle, he's in the limelight as always but with more brand-new expectations, higher than the skies, from now on, it's going to be a tough bloody fight, even more hard-hitting work for such a brilliant director. Hopefully, he lives up to being a trend-setter film-maker. He has set himself a trade-mark that's difficult to erase and hence I wish him good luck & congratulations for the glorious appreciation that he will continue to bask in for a few days now.God bless the whole cast, crew & team of Vikram Movie! Waiting to see more!Original Content by Ar Deepika Dhilip#Vikram.

Well! I watched this movie and I still couldn't fathom what's extra special about this movie! Well . There are very few surprises. Logical blunders. Vijay sethupathi's Action sequences were inspired by Chotta Bheem! Gets beaten , eats some substance and gets some energy and then beats them up. It repeats atleast thrice.. Fahad and Kamal are awesome . Anirudh and Cameraman saves the movie most of the times..And if you couldn't guess who is the Ghost within 15 minutes , then you might enjoy the movie .one time watch..

Watch it for: Vijay Sethupathi, Action Scenes, Kamal HasanDon't expect anything like Kaithi or MaanagaramI will not say I have not become fan of Lokesh Kanagraj's direction after watching Kaithi,Kaithi is built up on sharp performances of average actors ( except Vijay ) and superb direction, story line, filmography, superb background musicsince 'Master' director started experimenting with established actors, and as with bollywood, when an actor becomes star - his stardom over shadows his character in the movie- south film industry also could not remain unaffected.Unlike Maanagaram and Kaithi, director relied on Stars on both of his latest creations - Master and Vikram.Vikram's story starts with a sharp special agent but keeps jumping to many characters of the movie. The moment you feel now story line is created, a new event or character unsettles everything. Unnecessary references to characters or events of previous movies just reminds how good his direction used to be - viewers exclaims in hall - but it does not sustains.In Kaithi, suspense along with nice BGM at right time and events creates magic, but in Vikram - even beating an unarmed senior police officer has been tried to spice up with extravagant music.Director seems to highly influenced by Denzel Washington of Equalizer where he keeps watching at his hand watch - but in Vikram - don't know how Kamal Hasan's looking repeatedly at his hand watch relates to anything.Also, Mr. Lokesh Kanagraj, seems to be a fan of Dark Knight series so he has used ""mask man's"" voice to impress the viewers - but by the end of movie there is no mask and not any suspenseful voice.At the ending, as it is trend now a days with all movies and web series - it is said to be brain child by Ekta Kapoor - directors put lots of details for next installment, L. Kanagraj has also tried hard by adding entry of another Super Star of South industry and the whole team of Kaithi.No doubt people are brought to movie halls because of superb marketing.But, ye public hai, very soon public starts responding if they find the 'Gol Gappas' of the street vendor are no more have same tastes.

The movie starts immediately after where Kaithi ends the film is better than kaithi. The best performance is by far by Fahaad Faasil who plays Amar his story arc is amazing how he becomes one of the supporting characters to one of the main characters. Kamal Hassan is like the Amitabh Bachchan of South cinema. He shines in this especially after the interval. I watched it in cinemas and the atmosphere there was incredible. At the interval everyone clapped their hands and cheered. Sethupathi is amazing in his role as a mindless psycho horny villian. I didn't know Suriya could be so scary looking watch the end you won't regret it. Positive points are
Anirudh BGM
Sethupathi
Faasil
Kamal Hassan
And lokesh's cinematic universe
Watch it and do yourself a favour.

A desperate cry for attention by the Tamil audience. An attempt was made to rebuttal the success shown by other south film industries off late, but Vikram didn't quite earn its spot. The actors were amazing and the effort put was applaudable, how the actors came together to have Kollywood's position on the top charts claimed is truly commendable. But it did fall short and the hype is not worth it, as said before, it's the audience hoping to fake their way into an illusion of a ground shattering breakthrough for their industry.

If this much drugs selling is there as shown in movie whole world will be screwed up. Meaningless movie with Non-existing drug smuggling problems & so much violence. If you want to see blood shed and violence just play video games, instead of watching this movie. Only respect meaningful movies like soorarai potru or Jai Bhim.

First half of the movie is occupied throughout the performance of Fahadh Faasil as Amar. VJS as Sandhanam plays terrific antagonist role who tries a lot for his family. There is only few shades of Kamal Hassan as Vikram throughout the first half. Even in this few zone, Vikram shined very well.Interval block was predictable but the performance of this trio made it engaging along rockstar's bgm. Action scenes in this movie were blood chilling. Many side characters were given with noticable screen space.The technicians were the true backbone of this cinematic work. The Dop was great and editing was good.At last Lokesh Kanagaraj, the man in-form, was the guy Indian cinema needed. Lokesh please make your cinematic universe to expand.

422,ajsutha," Vikram - a tribute to kamal
","<span class=""review-date"">4 June 2022</span>","
I will start with the negatives since there were only a few. 1) the film could have been shortened by 20-30 mins. 2) while the gun sequences were done like a Hollywood film, some of the others were like a typical Indian film. Would like so see a film where the hero hits a bad guy and he doesn't go flying 20 feet üòÖ.Ok now to the positives! Lokesh proved once again he can direct a multi starrer flawlessly. All other directors should take notes. This time he gave Kamal, Fadah, and VJS all equal space. Kamal May not have a lot of dialogue in the first half of the film, but the second half more than makes up for it. Fadah did a great job in his role and VJS played yet another devious villain (even worse than in master). The first half of the film was all about diving into the story of the film. Lokesh introduces the story as a normal cop-goon film, then takes a turn at the interval. Kamal Hassan looked great for his age and showed that he could give an industry hit again. Anirudh continues to elevate his game with each film. The BGM and songs were all nice and suited the film amply. And finally the climax and intertwining of films! Surya emerges as the don leader ""Rolex."" He comes to know that Vikram is the one that stole his drugs and weapons and puts a bounty on him. The same batch of drugs was referenced in kaithi. Looks like part 2 of Vikram will be surya vs kamal and karthi. Overall, good film that you need to stick with in the beginning, but then get your mind blown away in the end.

","<span class=""review-date"">10 July 2022</span>","
At least objectively it's terrible for a crime / action film. The acting is poor; the direction haphazard; the incessant pounding music foolish; the plot so disjointed that it can hardly be followed, and the action scenes silly.What you might expect from a mediocre1970s-era Hollywood film in this genre. Except that wouldn't cut to scenes of people simply prancing around.Must be a fan-boy flick in India. There's no other possible justification for it to exist or for the high rating here.

Vikram is one of the greatest South Indian movie ever. Like KGF, RRR and Pushpa that movie is best of South Indian industry. Story, Action, Emotions, Thrill, Twists, Camera angels, Actors Performances and especially BGMs, they nailed it in every way. Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil all did a tremendous job and Kamal Haasan was the star of the show in every way, he was the best among bests but highlight of the movie was Suriya cameo, If he can create that magic in just 2 minute of appearance what will he do in Vikram 2 where he will me in the whole movie. Because of Vikram performance, Vikram 2 will be the most anticipated movie of India like Baahubali 2 and KGF 2.

Vikram movie review (3.5*):First of all, this is completely a Lokesh Kanaga Raj movie. So dont expect a Kamal Haasan movie.Positives: Story, actors, intro song, interval block and climax.Negatives: There are lags. Movie could have been littles short.Why to watch the movie:Excellent performances and connection with Kaithi:Kamal Haasan (We don't feel he is aged in intro song and action sequences. Especially in the climax shooting sequence, he is really fit and very convincing. However, missed the actor Kamal Haasan)Fahad: Neat and clean performance. He is simply superb and right choice for the role.Vijay Sethupathi: As usual, did his job very well. Excellent intro. But not very much different from his previous roles.AND the highlight of the movie is 'SURIYA'. JUST WATCH HIM AT THEATRE. OUT OF BOX PERFORMANCE.It is a commercial movie for a theatre experience. So dont watch it on mobile.

I loved this film. This film has a perfect mixture of Love, Care & Darkness of Humans and it did explored it pretty damn well. Specially Kamal Hassan Sir at this age what a man he is to perform such high energising role, he could give a run for his money to even Hrithik Roshan as we saw Hrithik in War Movie.

","<span class=""review-date"">2 November 2022</span>","
Watched this movie months after its release. My initial apprehension regarding the violence was completely true. I watched it after rewatching Master and Kaithi, and I preferred these two over Vikram, probably because both karthi and vijay did not exhibit this much of brutal power. All the agents in Vikram had the same attacking style, which honestly wasn't appealing.As a stand-alone movie, loved the BGM in most of the scenes. Personally Fahadh was superb. Liked Kalidas's portrayal as well. VJS's intro was good.Did not understand what VJS kept popping in his mouth, to get that hulk power. They deliberately kept him low key to increase surya's power. But VJS has had much better roles in multi-starrers.Finally, the VFX looked really amateur in some places surprisingly, and the baby getting CPR after 10-15 minutes was stupid.I wonder how much more gore will be there in the next movie, given that ppl loved this one.

","<span class=""review-date"">7 June 2022</span>","
Vikram is a written and directed by Lokesh kanagaraj, previously known for Kaithi, Master etc.Its stars Kamaal Haasan, fahaad Faasil, and Vijay sathupathi in lead.Its story revolves around a drug lord and his missions which are eventually or directly encountered by the government forces.As the the music suggest its a story of ghost and his agendas and his operations with his team.First half of the film builds the plot about the main character coincides with the drug mafia mission. The screenplay written for the interval block is just superb it literally put everyone guessing.Later the interval there isn't much story or plot to unveil its solely depends upon the acting performance of Kamal Haasan, Vijay and Fahad and and cult screenplay of the captain Lokesh Kanagaraj.The climax sequences are so well shot and directed its just pure entertainer for the audience to experience. Lokesh Kanagaraj past movie ""Kaithi"" and its connections to this and to its UPCOMING VENTURES, the universe he is in making shows its vision towards cinema. Theaters blasted for the last sequence.The acting performance of Kamal Haasan sir the way he has portrayed the shade of that character and dialogue's are superb the action sequence he performed just nailed it there. Vijay Sethupati right from its entry itself the negative shade and his fear for the people and his fear from the top the chain are very well shown by him and that's also in few screens. Fahad faasil is the one who runs you through the story to hid and reveal things and eventually going through pain he nailed his role right from the first shot till the end.Action sequences are so well choreograph and brutal are just treat to watch and also not for the children to watch.The characterization else than leads are done well whether its on protagonist side or antagonist's. Few charters just looted the screen for some time.Few comedy punches put in-between landed well for the story.The romantic angle in Fahad characters life and the love between the Kamal Haasan and his grand child fits so well in all the chaos, and melts down smoothly.Its all and all A BLOCKBUSTER Well Presented by the the Director Lokesh Kanagaraj. Kamaal sir's trust in him proved by this film. His Exceptional writing of the screenplay. Keeps engaged till the end.The Climax! That Climax where he connected his past film Kaithi starrer Karthi, and introduced the negative charter yet loved by all who literally was a Icing on a cake for every Tamil film watcher.Yes for the upcoming films of Lokesh or his this universe to understand one must watch Kaithi first for the references coming in-between or later to understand the subplot.Kamal Haasan's charm is insane.

Cast and crew has shared the screen space equally and hats off to the director for making it happen. Definitely a treat for Kamal, Vijay sethupathi, Fahadh and Anirudh fans. This movie has a lot of twist and turns. I do not want to break it here. Watch it in big screen. Lokesh has proved he is a true fan boy of kamal haasan.

NEVER,seen such a mind-blowing action movie with wonderfully message for society. This movie was taken not only for the audience to enjoy and praise their acting but it also been taken to convey a strong message about drug free life. Also Kamal sir have never fail to impress the audience with his acting. Love you Kamal Sir.

The Loki Universe is back with another classic mass buster known as Vikram. The movie is classic and never lets the screen play and the flow down. Keeps you on the edge of your seat till the end. The best part of the movie is it gives time for the story to setup and it provides good character development which lacks in most of the mass movies now a days. The music in the movie is perfect Anirudh has killed it as always. Talking about acting from Kamal Hassan to Fahadh Faasil everyone has played their role perfectly and not forgetting Vijay Sethupati amazed us with his villain acting as always and gives perfect badass vibes. The movie setups the cinematic universe perfectly and gives us hints about upcoming oprtunities and not to forget about ROLEX BHAI aka Suriya his cameo amazed in the ending and assured me that the upcoming projects by Lokesh Kanagaraj going to be fire.

Vikram is celebration of actor kamal Haasans return to cinema after 4 years break. Kamal has proved that age is just a number. He is rockstar @67 and world class actor.The star cast fahadh faasil, vijay sethupathi and surya has done amazing acting complementing kamal haasan. The director lokesh has proved that he is gonna stay for long and bring quality movies in indian cinema.Music by Anirudh is the soul of the movie. He has given the best BGM so far in his career.Action by duo Anbariv is superb and theyre the best stunt directors in indian cinema now.Overall the story, screenplay, direction, music, cinematography, action , acting are top notch.Good to see people are coming with family and enjoying the best movie experience.Its a industry hit and everyone is happy from producers, distributors, exhibitors and fans.Looking forward to watch next sequel ....kamal haasan and surya clash...its gonna break all time records in indian cinema.Those who havent watched in Big screen will regret after watching in OTT.Dont miss the opportunity. Go for it guys.

This is the kind of movie which I enjoy. This movie is not like the typical masala movie where the lead is everything and doesn't focuses on the lead, Vikram! Every characters have equal screen presence and all are important which will brainstorm one to think what might happen next?! Awsome BGM, great screenplay and two three scenes runs parallally creating equal amount of suspense and emotions, the emotions were touchy, the action scenes - which are not exaggerated like a superhero fight and mostly the the climax and the villain Rolex!!! It made watch two more films i.e Vikram 1986 and Kaithi of lokiverse and those were equally outstanding as Vikram Hitlist. Please do watch it!

Vikram was a pure labor of passion and a 100% directorial venture of Lokesh so far in his filmography. I loved ""Kaithi"" movie but when I compare it with Vikram the daughter sentiment portion that Kaithi had was taking a bit more space or like mellowing down the screen play where as in Vikram we see a husband trying to save his wife , a grand father trying to save his grand son, drug lord trying to save his empire but these where handled with a subtle note such a way it didn't spoil the thriller that was unfolding in front of us. Some brilliant screen play out here.There were moments in the film which audience were so invested and engrossed clapping their ways as the story unfolds.Every Technical aspect fell in place perfectly for this movie. There wasn't anything that was underwhelming for me throughout the crazy ride.For me I found this movie thoroughly engaging start to finish with the stellar cast including three mammoths of south cinematic talents whose craft speaks for itself.Ok Surya was supposed to be a surprise but boom as the spoilers went out in advance before the movie got released his character appearing wasn't having that wow factor but nevertheless he gives us a promising glimpse of the next season.Can't wait for the next instalment to see what's there in Lokesh's vision.

Review is not a cup of my tea. However, I couldn't but writing this review. The first thing of this movie I like is its BGM. Aniruddha did an amazing job. Character development is okay. Cinematography is top notch. Although many audiences do not like action sequence of south movies as movies defy logic, i do not have problem with that. However, this movies action choreography is up to the mark. Hand to hand fight is good. The most important thing, story, is good and screenplay supports the story. In a word, this movie is complete package.

Vikram is something which is driven by sheer individual excellence of Kamal Vijay and Mr Faasil.Faasil outshines in this movie , carrying the whole movie on his shoulder 1st Half. Vijay was given a raw look and his physical experience and character was his strong skill not much to do with acting though.For Kamal fans it was a feast. Gripping movie that binds you till the end. A bit overstretched, FAHAADH is the show stealer. We have definitely seen better action thrillers in Hollywood. This movie is certainly not the zenith but definitely a must watch.The supporting cast surprises and some of the action sequences are LIT.Good Screenplay !

","<span class=""review-date"">9 June 2022</span>","
I have always had a soft spot for Indian movies. At their best they produce stylistic entertainment while taking some artistic liberties to cater to their target audience. Vikram is Indian cinema at its best.Vikram manages to keep the perfect blend of style and substance most the time. The first half of the movie runs as an investigative thriller building up the story while building up Kamal Haasan's character. Fahadh Faasil does a really good job alongside Vijay Sethupathi compensating for Kamal Haasan's lack of presence in the first half. The first half ends on a really high note even though the big twist is predictable.The second half goes all in on the action and thrills, constantly raising the stakes while managing a grounded and emotional angle. Kamal Haasan really shines in the second half except in the action sequences. Lokesh Kanagaraj does the impossible by managing the heroism of a star actor and making the audience feel that things are still at stake. However, in my opinion, some parts of the third act of the movie could have been written better.Vikram is a fantastic movie. Despite some minor issues the movie can be enjoyed by any type of movie fans. Hat's off to Lokesh and Kamal Haasan. Waiting for the ""Lokeshverse"" to expand.

I'm a fan of LK. All his other movies from managaram to master seemed authentic as most of the scenes from those movies were relatable to our everyday life, such as town bus journey in traffic, TASMAC bar fight, cab driver mentality, kaithi karthi's narration and dialogue delivery we're all relatable to common man's life. But Vikram is kinda extreme and out of scope and seems like LK deliberately wanted to showcase his passion towards guns, Kamal, etc and nothing in the movie seems realistic to my belief. The only good part is cast and their acting, music and BGM.

Firstly, I am trying to be Spoiler less but pardon me if I Spoil something!Lokesh Kanagaraj Delivers yet another masterpiece after Kaithi (Master was hit & miss case) The way he has brought together all the characters and linked this film with Vikram (1986) and Kaithi (2019) is just awesome. Coming at the the performances all the characters were at their best, especially Kamal sir, Sethu Annan and Fahad Faasil. The cameo of Suriya is mind-blowing that smile he gives just takes you elsewhere. Story wise it's really good and a must watch to all those that like Action Thrillers! Music is spot on yet again Anirudh delivers Mass music that and this time it gets the justice unlike his last few films where Music was way better than the sequences. Finally, the film doesn't bore you even for a second and there are some really good elevation scenes, comedy scenes (yes they are here and are well placed) plus emotions. All-in-all, it's A Festival for all the fans of Kamal Sir and Action-Crime lovers!By the way, you shouldn't approach this film as a standalone film, if you think so then you are mistaken and might find this film to be average! Plus, if you have watched Kaithi before itself you will get the references but if you haven't go watch it first because that is a must (atleast that's what I feel) , The ending of the film is so special The Lokesh Kangaraj Crime & Mafia Cinematic Universe is on!

I can't exactly tell you how I feel before and after seeing this film. I'm just wowed and impressed for what Lokesh has done. The storyline, action, music, cinematography and the lot were top notch.This is also my first time seeing Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi, Suriya and Fahadh Faasil on the big screen and I enjoyed all their performances to this film.The only negative feedback I have is that it lagged a few times but not too many times. Every shot is worthy to see.I saw this film in the UK and the auditorium was full (3rd day of release) and it was an amazing experience to see everyone enjoying to see their favourite actors on screen. Especially when Suriya appeared for a few minutes, people were cheering loud. This also happened with the other actors as well.The other Indian film I've seen in cinema was ""Beast"" starring Thalapathy Vijay. Comparing these two films I've seen, Vikram wins obviously. Not saying I didn't enjoy watching Beast but it was a experimental type of film when compared to Vikram which had everything you ever need in a film and beyond.That is why this is the best Indian film I've seen this year and all my life!

Just Amazing, Just have to watch . You have to go and watch the film. Its Lokesh Kanagaraj best film and Anirudh done amazing scores. It's a sequel from 2019 Kaithi, every character was detailed properly.

Lokesh has written a marvelous action film with suspenseful situations at each frame. This is the first proper investigative thiller film in tamil. Perfect editing and technically marvelous,the movie contains numerous nail biting ,edge of the seat sitting scenes. Lokesh has properly created a piece for his idol,Kamal Hassan.Acting wise ,not only the three supremes Vijay sethupathi,Fahad fasil,Kamal, many small characters have been used properly. All the charecters were necessary to the film,there were no unnecessary scenes.Atlast,why is it a top notch film,because it doesn't feel like a movie,you simply mix into the emotions of the film,it doesn't feel alien to you.

Actually first half is driven by the character karnan and fahadh actually follows the character. Never watched a movie got entire theatre claps for the first half alone. Interval fight scene was technically sound & you can watch it 100 times u won't get bored.

Those who loves marvel continuous movies should watch this movie first watch Kaithi then this. Every scene is a mass action and every heros contributed well. It has a good story, emotions, revenge and well loaded actions. When regular heros turn into negative side they make a very good contribution like that two villains in this movie made the movie very interesting. Another hit of ulaga nayagan.

Lokesh has proved that he is worthy with this extravagant film. He has connected all the different characters parts very well and shown everyone equally, none of the characters were let down. Even-though the movie is lengthy the fast paced scenes made it worth ever scene. The writing is perfect creating an arc for the characters from Kaithi(2019) and the cameo by Suriya was again a great move by the director. Anirudh's background scores were a banger, elevated every scene 100x. The technical works also have to be mentioned, Using mocobot in the interval sequence was very well done, reminded me of the fight scenes from 'The Kingsman'. A one good movie after years!

After a long time, a new attempt from the Tamil film industry which keeps you engaged and thrilled. The duration of this movie is 173 minutes. Believe me, you will not feel the movie is dragging. From the start till the end, the plot and the screenplay keeps you engaged. Characterization for all the lead actors Kamalhaasan, Vijay Sethupathi, Fahad Faasil, Chemban Vinod Jose, Narein and other supporting actors were well crafted and delivered flawlessly. Writers did a great job by giving equal screen spaces to the 3 lead actors.Kamal, VJS, FaFa - What a terrific performances!!! Kamal, as a senior, gave space to other co-actors to perform but when he starts performing, he tops the chart obviously that is why he's is fondly known as ""Ulaga Nayagan"" (Universal Hero). VJS and his tremendous characterization and mannerism is new and terrific. FaFa is the driving factor in this movie who takes us to the plot. He has slightly more screen space than the other two to be frank.Technically speaking, starting from music, bgm, sound design, cinematography, dialogues, screenplay, production design, all were top class. Stunt Choreography by AnbuAriv has a powerful influence. The way it was choreographed was never seen before in the industry. Simple yet powerful dance Choreography by Sandy made everyone look at him as a magician who recreated Kamal's signature dance steps.Direction has to be mentioned on a separate note coz it is fully evident that Lokesh Kanagaraj who is an ardent fan of the leading actor Kamalhaasan has made his mind very clear that he wants to see and show to the public his idol in a different level and he had put his blood and soul to it. The final product itself is the result of his hard work. The surprise elements placed in the movie and the links he had brought from his earlier movie Kaithi and Kamal's 1986 movie Vikram is a new thing to Tamil Cinema. We had seen many sequels and prequels, but this one is Universal.Cameo appearance by Kalidas Jayaram has a strong impact to the story. Another powerful Cameo by Actor Surya is a surprise element to this high octane thriller. Only a 3 - 4 minutes of his screen presence set the screens on fire.Overall, a must watch movie on theatres near you. You will watch this movie on a repeat mode.Vikram is definitely the savior of Tamil Cinema post pandemic where the previous theatre releases by other top actors did not perform well. Given the pressure by other Indian language movies, Vikram from Kollywood stands alone and gives back to all of them in style.

Kamal sir: I don't have to say about the man's performance. Everything was on point. Pride of indian cinema. He is proving himself as a man of cinema everytime he releases a film. Even though he had only 10% screen time in the first half, his presence is felt. And his intro in the intravel was simply awesome.Fahad fazil and Vijya sethupathi: Both actors were amazing and Fahad just ruled the first half by his fantabulous performances. He was so. Vijay sethupathi's role as Santhanam was similar to bhavani in master, but he aced the role with his raw and lethal body language and mannerism.Background score and songs: Anirudh is hitting back to back with his amazing score. Vikram had has 3 major scores and 2 songs. All were fantastic. Expectations for Anirudh's music is getting bigger.Story, screenplay, Camera works and Loki's direction: A good mark for a director is not only the story but also the screenplay. Vikram's screenplay was simply super. The strong screenplay and direction of Lokesh kanagaraj foreshadowed the rather predictable story. For example, most people can predict vikram is alive right after he stages his killing right in the beginning of the movie. The scene where he reveals his is still alive and kicking is a goosebump and whistle worthy scene.Overall vikram is one of the badass multistarrer ever made in indian cinema. Everyone did their best work. Also Suriya sir as Rolex and kaithi merger scene was just amazing. Now that we know what a 100% loki film looks like, just imagine thalapathy 67 in the same universe, which is also a 100%loki film.üî•üî•üî•

In movie industry, some will give a nice movie. In this vikram is one of the best movie with the full pack entertainment. Let's see 1st half of movie is slightly slow because of investigation but at interval everyone felt a goosebumps. The screenplay is designed packfully. Then about music it's rock. Then about 2nd half of movie moved quiet well. At last the 5 minutes cameo role by actor by suriya is most rocking. Dir lokesh gives movie as his own as a great satisfaction for audience. At last the sequential between kaidhi and vikram is made a perfect. I think this sequential and movement of this movie is perfect.

This movie showcases top notch actors with perfect roles with the mastermind Lokesh's story
weaved into so many layers with anirudh's phenomenal background score that just immerses you in the dark world of his.It just hits you with pure quality action with a pinch of emotion strong enough to keep the movie driven for 3 hours. The way the movie accelerated towards the intermission with 30 mins of action drama was amazing. All three stars shined in their own roles and proved what good acting can do. I never thought ill get emotional over an old man spilling a packet of
milk on the floor. Made my expectations skyrocket now. Congrats to the whole team for putting up what I call a good film.

Super excited after watching VIKRAM.It's a pack of legendary actors showcasing their excellencies. Tangling of plot and execution of the story is simply awesome. Kamal especially surprised his audience with a massive comeback. Lokesh, as a director, took the flick to another level of Tollywood with its unusual unique delivery of concept. Anirudh's background score and music made the viewers to enjoy and feel the screen moments. The way story connects to former LK's signature movie is unexpected. Vikram is something Tamil industry had never before , but will ever after.

It has satisfied the hype it has given. It's been a long awaited movie. It's a must watch in big screens one. All actors nailed their roles with near perfection most importantly Vijay Sethupathi and Fahad Fasal. Andavar is amazing as usual. The two pillars of the movie success are screen play and music. Anirudh has done a outstanding work. Every moment he rules the screen with his tracks. I fell in love with the fight scenes and camera work in night.It's so obvious that this movie is gonna create records and set new standards. Young and talented directors like Lokesh kanagaraj should be appreciated and given more chances.

609,mendonmrinal," Gripping edge of the seat action movie
","<span class=""review-date"">7 June 2022</span>","
Indian cinema always clamors for a gripping, intelligent action movie and Mr. Kanagaraj delivers one here. After the success of movies like Kaithi, Master here is another mass entertainer from the director. The movie is an absolute treat to witness with a story that goes from hunting murderers of police all the way to uncover a conspiracy of evil policemen under the payroll of drug lords. Kamal haasan's acting is a sight to behold with his action sequence, dance and expressions and mannerism all taking centre stage in the movie. Fahad Fasil almost steals the show from Mr. Hasssan in his own movie with his brilliant portrayal of Black ops esque officer that tries to solve cases by using underhand tactics and going completely off book. With his ruthless demeanor and witty one liners he evolves with every role and has an unbeatable impact on the audience. Last but not the least, after his brilliant portrayal as a villain in master we are again treated to the absolute joy that is Vijay Sethupati. The actor of the masses brilliantly playing as the Drug Lord with three wives and huge family. With his spectacular entry my only gripe is unlike Master where he too had chirpy dialogues here Vijay is left to fend for himself in a movie with such solid performances from everyone. He nearly sails through because he is Vijay and his onscreen charisma and charm are unbeatable. The music by Anirudh is griping with metal riffs blowing as the action takes place on screen. The cinematography and editing of action is also noteworthy with the actions in tight spaces like a corner, corridor, stairs come off like a well-choreographed sequence of events that feel natural. There are a lot of decapitations in the film from the get go. Unlike Kaithi where the story was always on an upward trajectory between edge of the seat action and spaces to take a breather Vikram's screenplay has an up and down trajectory especially for the first half of the film. The second half is when all hell breaks loose and we are treated to delightfully choreographed action sequences right out of the Hollywood movies. Mr. Kanagaraj saves the best surprise for last where he connects Kaithi to Vikram and brings out the big bad drug lord as Surya. He looks ferocious and acts ruthless and will be a challenge to overcome for kamal hassan, fahad fasil and karthi in the next movie.

Mann what a film. Vikram is what saved kollywood from continuous flops. No drags, no heroism, no unnecessary masalas. A full on action flick that makes the audience to sit with their eyes wide open. It is so fast paced that some people might find it difficult to keep up with it but man I finally watched a good film after a long time. Everyone have put in their 100% effort into this film. Surya's cameo was brilliant in the last 5 mins. Those kaithi references was so good. Kamal, vjs and fafa were fantastic and it didn't even feel like they were acting. Narain was great too. Background music was fantabulous, this is where anirudh belongs. But man the genius behind the screen is lokesh. I sincerely ask lokesh to bring vijay out of his comfort zone and not carry on with his usual heroism. Make the next film 100 percent yours and do not tamper the story by any means...

Vikram movie has many twist and turns which gives goosebumps. Even small characters, did their job very well. It's night scene visuals are tremendous. We can see perfect night visuals than Batman night scenes. Really want to appreciate props art , lighting and DI team. Anirudh nailed the bgm, each and every scene with bgm reminds me that i am watching Hollywood movie. But this movie better than hollywood. I believe one day loki universe will meet marvel and dc characters.

Even the original Vikram is much better entertainer. The plot is very weak. Few loose ends are never tied together. VSP and Kamal are too fat and ugly to be cast in any movie. You hardly need any acting skill or work ethic to play these roles. Nothing unique about them. In fact, it's easy for them to be fat and drunk. I certainly can't handle another version of this with Soorya as villain. Good bye Vikram franchise! Kamal should stop acting and keep the dignity of his past roles. 4/10 is a generous rating. Fahad's performance is pretty good as expected.

Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan is back and back with a bang. Captivating performances from Fahad and Sethupathi keep you hooked on to the screens while the rich background score takes the movie to an epic level. Kamal Haasan again demonstrates the range of acting that he is known for. While the first half is a lesson on story telling, the second one is a roller coaster ride of action, action and action. The action scenes are spectacular and perfectly aided by cheesy dialogues. Vikram is a movie made for theatres and it should be a sin not to watch it there. Don't miss it.PS: Watch Kaithi if you are able to. Will help in understanding some links.

Puts the entire Bollywood industry to shame with them unable to make a single movie of this calibre since a decade. The movies coming from Tollywood ( Pushpa )
Kollywood ( KGF-2 ) have been taking the Indian Film Industry with their stories, visuals and the best BGM's some of which are even better than Hollywood movies at a fraction of the cost. The appeal to every film enthusiast is undeniable.

Superb movie I have ever scene in my life ever . I didn't had any expectation for this film . But when 8 saw it , I was so thrilled by its story , the actors performances , especially Fahd Fassil, who I didn't even Knew , I became his fan after seeing this movie, and the other two tamil superstars , who are known for their overwhelming performance in the silver performed more better , and gave their fullest and made this film a superhit not only in India but also abroad . Even though it didn't made enough collection in North belt area , South belt was enough to make it superhit. Somedays the overseas box office collection was more than the collections in India which shows that this movie is a blockbuster. This movie creator/producer/team didn't do so much promotion in the Northbelt region and even didn't got much screens in North, if it had done more promotion and got more screens than I am sure this movie which have collected 450cr INR , would have easily surpassed 500cr INR, may have even done more . Hope this movie would become more famous by the time it's second part will be released , as many north Indians will see it in Ott(Disney+ Hotstar) and I'm sure they would love this film and watch it's second part .This movie has already done a record in ott as it has been watched by many people, Iam waiting for its second part so eagerly and I'm sure it's second part will be a superhit and I missed one thing , that is the Vikram director the Legend Lokesh Kanagaraj , is also directing Tahlapathy Vijay's 67th Movie , and if he adds this movie to LCU(Lokesh Cinematic Universe) that Kaithi-Vikram-Thalapathy 67 , then I am sure this Universe will be the Top Cima Universe in India . In conclusion I would like to say that this movie is the Real Beast .

648,shankarramanb," Poor writing, made tolerable by Fahad and Vijay S's characters
","<span class=""review-date"">21 June 2022</span>","
This movie tries and fails to leverage the well made Kaithi (2019). It has a hodgepodge of characters, subplots and over the top action. The movie focuses on impressing only through slow motion effects and flamboyance of big name actors. Vikram is a poorly written movie that runs too long at 3 hours. The saving grace of the first half of the movie is Vijay Sethupathi's character - Sandhanam and Fahad Fazil's character - Amar. But for those two characters the movie is a failed attempt at covering the story of undercover agents and criminals. Skip this to save time.

","<span class=""review-date"">6 August 2022</span>","
Vikram is very good as an action showcase.Story is good. It is relatable and lively filled with emotions and a bit of social awareness. Where second half unfolds the story and drives it toward the end, its first half is more engaging.All the actors gave a brilliant performance and perfectly suited the role. Most suitable is Fahadh, whose character Amar has probably the best arc in the movie. He can be considered second protagonist in the movie. While the main protagonist Vikram also has a definable story, the movie puts more focus on stardom of Kamal Hassan and gives him some swaggy slow motion sequences and gunfight amid the realistic fights, which is not bad, if one knows the legend of Kamal. The colour scheme, environment, BACKGROUND SCORE and prevalence of majority of night sequences perfectly delivers the theme of struggle against the crime& corruption and vigilant action.The antagonist, being an underdog, is less impactful, but not the performance of Setupathy. But it may prove good for its sequels, yes. The suspense is weak as it is predictable but the part that involves the unfolding of mystery is never boring because it gives build-up to all three characters simultaneously.Overall, Vikram will entertain you in terms of action, story and story arc of its mammoth characters.

","<span class=""review-date"">28 August 2022</span>","
I don't think that this movie deserves above 8+ rating out of 10. Too much needless action. No logic behind the action scene.kamal Hasan does not need the plot,the plot needs him and it is the main motive of director. The director tries to develop three different plots at the same time but he failed to do it properly. By the way agent Tina's action scene and some action scenes are good to watch.do not waste your precious 3 hours to watch this average and over hyped movie.the movie is for those who likes only action not story plot realistic characters.they only need reckless action scenes where the hero is not human type.

Full of action and entertainment with emotional part filled with in .great felling of excitement and developing dopamine while watching it.the pilot black squad group at the end will give u sudden ghus bumps which you never expected from starting .at the begining you never able to identify what will be the overal image of the story. Shocking scene in each part of the whole movie.in my opinion the director have big brain. How a common man could be converted into a person like black squad may be your best part .the last fighting scence was seriously one of my best experience ever.watching this entire movie with 1060p is even better because ofs its bfx effects .the overall story is by the way very good. But, in some parts I fells like over or no logic. Like at the end how vikram can be able to think that his grandson will be breath after 10 minutes?even through you are a genius you can not say exactly in that situation.18+scene also included in it so you can not watch with family members it will be negative impact on your little sister or brothers.

Well,is it possible to make a part 2 after 50 years with the same excitement that my father had when he was 18. Now i get the same amount of goosebumps. And i am 18 my name is also Arun Kumar Vikram . The way the character introduction was perfect. Because there are many characters but no lag though out the movie.The unmasking scenes were perfectly balanced between protoganist and antoganist. The movie was actually connected to the vikram(1986) and kaithi(2019). The movie really tells about the untold agents of our country and the political game behind it. The movie deals with drugs and related stuffs. Thank you hopefully enjoy the movie with your friends and family.

660,siddharthj-98054," A Partial Lokesh Kanagaraj film, Anirudh's music is the best part about the film.
","<span class=""review-date"">8 May 2023</span>","
The first half of the film seems to be engaging where in we are tagging along with the protagonist (Played by Fahadh Faasil who has done a brilliant job btw), But things change into a fanboy, plot armoured, commercial story by the second half. Unnecessary scenes, overlong action scenes and the story depending on Kamal's hype train which is not required at all, Unless Lokesh got carried away due to his love for Kamal. The actors have done a great job portraying the characters. But the characters itself like Fahadh's girlfriend played by Gayathri was not a well written character, because she was used as a plot device or a character development for Fahadh's character. Anirudh's music is the best part of the film, As it provides the excitement, edge of the seat thrilling background score which elevates the cool factor and style of the movie. Kamal has definitely done his best as he would in every other movie of his. Vijay Sethupathi also played a terrifying villain. But what this movie needs more than anything is focused storytelling.The writing was very minimal in the second half.If you're going to watch for entertainment, You can definitely go for it without a second thoughtBut if you want to witness strong storytelling and character depths, This will not suffice.

It's a masterpiece of the Kamal + Lokesh duo. After 4 years gap Kamalhasan gave a thundering come back with Lokesh universe. Though it's a sequel to Lokesh's earlier movie "" Kaithi"" the plot and story are explained in detail. The interval scene is a goosebump situation. Waiting for ""Vikram -3"" last but not the least Anirudh BGM and music is a pillar for the movie.

Movie is all good no doubt about it, performance wise A grade as expected from all my favorite actors from south, even side actors also done a good work.With the pass of time as movie unfolds mystery gets deepen, hard to keep tabs on all the characters that's make it a good watch mind always puzzling what will happen next, who is on the good side who is bad.BGM is next level although I didn't watch it in theatre but throughout movie was engaging not a single scene was out of frame.AMAR(Farhad Fasil) chief of Black Squad is called to search down the group of radical militant which is hunting narcotics departments officer.Amar single handedly carry the first half of movie, found his character most intrigued.SANDANAM(Vijay S) leader of lungi gang, can be given more depth and dialogue, he was not that fearsome.VIKRAM(Kamal Hassan) typical south hero but in the role of grand pop is nicely done.But the most exiting thing about the movie is Lokesh Kangnaraj (director) how he connects the movie and make a worthy sequel and spiritual reboot and perfect entry gateway to LOKI UNIVERSE.

The movie is so absolutely well written that at the end of the film you'll understand everything very clearly. The cast nd crew is the best thing about this movie.

Absolutely amusing us with his bgm's nd music. And Kamal Sir nothing to say about him other than he is freaking best in the world.Overall One of the best movies to watch in theatres.

The leads from Kaithi was well tailored in Vikram, our expectations were certainly exceeed in terms of screenplay and scriptwriting. All casts did an extraordinary performance. Looking forward to the next sequel to this universe.

","<span class=""review-date"">11 July 2022</span>","
Direction and screen play are outstanding. All the dots are well connected ( khaidi, old Vikram). Kamal haasan acting as usual top notch. Fahad, Vijay sethupathi did an extremely good job.

","<span class=""review-date"">15 July 2022</span>","
The movie was perfect! The trio was blazing (Fahadh, VJS and definitely Ulaganayagan). I am not a Kamal fan but I like his movies, but this one just made me his new biggest fan! Kamal had pretty less screen time compared to the other two but managed to give a huge impact in just the second half alone. Fahadh's acting was strong as a pillar. The way he carried himself, his speaking style and overall his performance had just grew him a fanbase not only in Tamil Nadu but the entire world! VJS was a magic on the screens. He just lived his role and gave us a full satisfaction. Even though Sandhanam was not as mass as Bhavani absolutely loved him for his ruthlessness, style and villainess! Surya was on a different level by throwing an absolute over the roof performance in that short period of time considering he was out of his 'hero zone'. Anirudh just ROCKed the STARs moments on screen. The music was feeding the emotion for each and every scene, an absolute magician. Girish was just amazing especially the fight scenes during the intermission and climax. Not to forget the stunt brothers, Anbariv was just adding fuel to the fire at every fight and also the violence was amazingly intense making us jump off our seats! And our LCU founder was just insane! Lokesh managed to hold us for 3 hours and just made us go on an action roller-coaster! Of course the ending just had so many possible storylines for the next film in the universe be it Rolex vs Vikram/Dilli or the future Vikram Jr it was just a masterpiece! Previously my favourite movie was KGF Chapter 2 but now the ghost sits on the top! Make sure to watch this in theatres for the full experience and I guarantee you will fall in love with this and can't wait for the next one from Lokesh!
