58,naveensankaran18,1 November 2022, with some of the greatest actors in the business  this directorial from the exceedingly talented lokesh kanagaraj has everything a kamal movie has   an ambitious scale  plot driven characters  strong technicality  and respect for the cinematic intellect of a commoner  and of course  the man himself when a project of a mammoth scale is in development  a lot of things are at stake  there are numerous possibilities where it might not just work out  for such a project to make a victory leap  everything has to work properly  literally everything  it has to work big time and i am not just speaking about its commercial value  but its technicality  authenticity  and the culmination of every single person in the unit  everything just has to work  and vikram achieved every single one of these and much more than that at first  i thought vikram will be just another fanboy commercial  where the director might end up working  too  hard to make his beloved hero dance to his moves  resulting in a rather average product  however  lokesh had other plans  and boy oh boy did he execute it in style the  spin off  verse of lokesh kanagaraj   lcuthe term spin offs  crossovers  and multiverse are not new to cinema goers  especially the marvel fans  however  unlike in hollywood  it was pretty difficult to pull off something like that here in indian cinema  though cameo roles by established actors are rather prevalent  it stayed mostly as an idea and did not take the next step ahead  though there are exceptions in the horror comedy genre  there wasn t a movie that is so true to its core plot and character development  until lokesh came into the picture in most of his earlier interviews  lokesh never shied away from expressing his desire to make spinoffs and what ifs with his favorite characters  especially ulaganayagan s  the core concept of kaidhi  virumaandi  and even his last release master  nammavar  are great examples so  when kamal haasan suggested something on the lines of his yesteryear espionage thriller  vikram   lokesh saw an opportunity and grabbed it like anything   the opportunity to expand his universe on a large scale  to make a multi starrer that can lead to several other movies churning out in the future  to make it as a lokesh cinematic universe all of a sudden  everything became possible  it was possible to have a star like suriya play an incredibly brief yet intense role in the film  it was possible to ask big actors like fahadh faasil and vijay sethupathi to wait for a few more hours during the shoot  and it was possible to make a movie with one of the leading character not even appearing more than a few minutes in its entire first half  everything seemed possible  call it the recent ott trend  call it the new wave but for me  the reason is the man himself   kamal haasan  he made it possible  he made everything possible  even though he is not there entirely  just like a ghost kamal haasan   the ghostwith a career spanning over 60 years  the impact this man made on several individuals is purely limitless  so  whenever someone gets inspired by kh  it is as if the man is delivering himself  it takes pure guts from lokesh to have one s beloved hero in such an introductory sequence  as the title appears  even though kh is not there almost entirely in the first half  he is still there as a ghost  no  i am not mentioning the narrative but the writing  in the technicality  in providing proper characterization  in providing moments for almost every character to relish on screen  as he said at an award function  it was as if he was directing the movie  he was lokesh s ghost  yes  it is an interstellar reference  a 100  lokesh kanagaraj filmafter his 50  vijay 50  lokesh movie  master   lokesh promised a 100  lokesh movie and he delivered  right from the start  the narrative dove right into the plot  it did not deviate an inch  providing us an intense experience throughout  every single aspect expressed on the screen is somehow a part of the narrative  which is surprising for me  to the core  i mean  even the supposedly  hero introduction song  becomes part of the story after a while  i was expecting some emotional sequences like the ones in kaidhi and thought lokesh might not just succeed there but boy he surprised me there as well  yes  there is an emotional bond between vikram and the child but the child itself becomes part of the story and even an action block learning from his mistakes of the past  lokesh presented us with a narrative that stays true to its genre  yes  it has romance  songs  stunt sequences  care  affection  and pain  but all of them are part of the narrative  though seeming complex at first  the narrative opens itself slowly  offering us bread crumbs as we search through it  just as one of the characters mentions  some might call it boring  complex  or simply a gimmick  i will call it respecting the cinematic intellect of the audience  a commoner a fanboy moviewhat does one expect in a fanboy movie  the celebration  and a tribute  to one particular person who is adored and worshipped by many  it should have elements that are extremely true to that person  for instance  petta is a perfect example of a fanboy movie  where karthik subbaraj celebrated rajinism like anything  lokesh  who is an aandavar fan  as they call him   incorporated everything a kamal movie should have   ambitious scale  plot driven characters  accepting that the audience is more intelligent  and having the right people with you  who share an equal love towards the same human often termed as an actor who speaks with his eyes  it was a great addition to have fahadh faasil in vikram  he literally carried the entire first half on his shoulders  that is all about investigation and searching for bread crumbs  there is one sequence that involves him and a car driver  which was easily pulled off by the performer in fahadh  apart from being an extraordinary performer  he has been a constant admirer of the performer in kh  even one of his latest releases   malik   is a kind of ode to nayakan and the performer in kh  hence  i guess it was relatively easy for lokesh to convince him to take the extra leap  for the sake of ulaganayagan having already played one of the strongest antagonists ever  it was difficult for vijay sethupathi after master to essay a demoniac role that has a similar intensity and yet looks different entirely  though his role was overshadowed by other elements  his performance still stands apart from the rest  and there is something to take home  and this for me  is something good  this was a great space to make use of and vjs utilized it to his benefit  sharing the screen space with some of the finest co stars he could ever imagine there is one more character i want to write about  scream about  agent tina  though there were clues  i was completely taken aback by the character  and what a way to show perfect indian espionage  just wow  she is the dancing rose in this film   sarpatta parambarai movie reference   but for the sake of people who are yet to watch the movie  i will keep my mouth shut  for the moment  though the cameo was extremely short  the gruesome nature exhibited by suriya was something i was not prepared for  it was literally some ferocious  cold hearted stuff from such a performer after a really long time  i am just hoping to catch on to more of his grey shades in near future  but  just for a moment  i thought  what if the superstar himself has played the role  what if   the technicalitywith such an intense narration and most of it happening during the night  i could see the tiresome work from the entire technical crew members  with some great stunt sequences in its kitty  the twin duo of anbariv choreographed the action scenes as close as possible to the reality  without over the top stunts  with great support from girish gangadharan  cinematography  and philomin raj  editor   the action part looked authentic and gripping enough for the audience and did not let them slip away from the narrative as well the moment when a certain character steps out of a prostitute s room  anirudh started playing his magic where i understood he is literally doing everything he can to make the score sound different  be it the songs or the background score  anirudh is still one of the major reasons why people are flocking to theatres in this ott era special kudos to the ads who were sincere enough to cover the logic loopholes as much as possible  finally  cctv footage looks exactly like cctv footage final thoughtsoverall  it was purely a delight for cinephiles to witness the audience enjoy such a visual spectacle without many songs or hero appreciation  it s always the baby steps that matter and lokesh took a giant leap with vikram and i am happy that it is being received well by the audience and critics alike  i just wish this man stays for more mask revealing years to come  and am eager to witness his growth all along  ,4.0,8976,with some of the greatest actors in the business this directorial from the exceedingly talented lokesh kanagaraj has everything a kamal movie has an ambitious scale plot driven characters strong technicality and respect for the cinematic intellect of a commoner and of course the man himself when a project of a mammoth scale is in development a lot of things are at stake there are numerous possibilities where it might not just work out for such a project to make a victory leap everything has to work properly literally everything it has to work big time and i am not just speaking about its commercial value but its technicality authenticity and the culmination of every single person in the unit everything just has to work and vikram achieved every single one of these and much more than that at first i thought vikram will be just another fanboy commercial where the director might end up working too hard to make his beloved hero dance to his moves resulting in a rather average product however lokesh had other plans and boy oh boy did he execute it in style the spin off verse of lokesh kanagaraj lcuthe term spin offs crossovers and multiverse are not new to cinema goers especially the marvel fans however unlike in hollywood it was pretty difficult to pull off something like that here in indian cinema though cameo roles by established actors are rather prevalent it stayed mostly as an idea and did not take the next step ahead though there are exceptions in the horror comedy genre there wasn t a movie that is so true to its core plot and character development until lokesh came into the picture in most of his earlier interviews lokesh never shied away from expressing his desire to make

64,bijupillai73-1,11 June 2022, so much excitement for vikram  based on a character of the same name from the 1986 movie vikram who was a raw agent the basic story here goes as amar  fahad  and his team of black squads take up the case of high profile murders  serial killings  that eventually leads them to santhanam  vijay sethupathi   a drug lord and the  ghost   realizing that everything isn t what it seems to be  it s all out guns and glory from then on the buzz for vikram was there for a few years and then picked up momentum when the first teaser was released almost one and half years ago  the first teaser was just that  a tease  director lokesh kanakaraj said in an interview before the release of vikram that the teaser scenes were just shot to create a buzz among people  it had nothing to do with the actual movie though it gave us a taste of how the movie would be  the excitement peaked while watching with an audience comprising mostly of tamilians and a some malayalis  hoots  whistles  cheers  claps    it was a wild ride on and off screen  it was great to see that both tamilians and malayalis shouted out for both malayalam and tamil actors alike  no discrimination  pure love for the actors  just euphoria this is one of the most stylish mass action thriller movies out there now and it has incited mass hysteria among the audience as well  one of lokesh s best  though his  maanagaram  will always be my favorite  followed by  kaithi   kaithi was a ground breaking gangster movie  so fast paced  almost shot completely at night  on the road  out and out action with a sentimental thread of a father and daughter yearning to meet each other  actor karthi was awesome as dilli  now those who haven t watched  kaithi   must check it out as it too has connections with this new vikram  you can say lokesh is creating his own cinematic universe  the lkcu or lcu  he has created a script that makes vikram an extension of the movie  kaithi   vikram is one of those rare movies that has stayed true to its genre and trailers  you watch the trailer  you get an idea of what you will be watching and you get exactly that and more with utmost satisfaction  that is quite rare nowadays  as most trailers pump you up but the movie fizzles out  some scenes remind you of a quentin tarantino robert rodriguez martin scorcese  scorcese is one of lokesh s favourite hollywood director  style of movie making which is not bad at all because it results in visually stunning action scenes and set pieces  the movie has some of the most gruesome and creative kills and gore for an indian movie  with excellent cinematography by our very own girish gangadharan  who is also a national film award winner for best cinematography for the 2019 film  jallikkattu   which itself is an insanely beautiful magical world captured on camera  visually  jallikattu was an immersive experience  expected nothing less from ljp  the magician  girish gngadharan is also famous for his 11 minute single long take for the climax of the movie  angamaly diaries   another ljp movie coming to the actors  fahad fazil is no stranger to intense characters  his black squad agent amar  is sharp  dedicated and cold blooded as well  his difficulty in maintaining a love life while keeping the nature of his job a secret  seems so genuine  the one who acts with his eyes  fahad is in every way the perfect agent to step into kamal s shoes  if ever the story takes that route  fahad  as always is terrific in his role  probably a cake walk for him  both fahad and kamal has those intense eyes that tell us a million stories with one look  kamal haasan is back after a hiatus of almost 4 years  vishwaroopam 2 was his last outing and it didn t do too well at the box office  kamal once again proves why he is called  ulaga nayagan   universal hero   at 67  he reprises his secret agent role from the 1986 movie vikram  36 years later  though it s not ground breaking acting  not needed here  like some of his older famous characters  the moment he enters the picture  right from the beginning of the movie with the song  pathala pathala   you are mesmerized  when kamal cries in a certain scene  you feel it too  once upon a time  there lived a ghost  who is the ghost  i m not saying anything vijay sethupathi seemed to be having a lot of fun as drug kinkpin santhanam  a recent drug bust rattles him up and he needs to find and get it back   this is connected to the movie  kaithi   and that is all i will say about that  but vijay sethupathi was also terrific  pretty much straight forward bad guy with certain unique nuances  a joy to watch  and a sudden jolt of power inducing drug that he pops into his system in times of need  kalidas jayaram had a minor role and he performed well  surya as rolex in a cameo role  around 5 mins  stunned everyone  he was fire on screen which resulted in the audience screming out at the top of their lungs for his mind blowing performance  terror personified  narain as bejoy  also reprises his character from  kaithi  and did his part well  chemban vinod jose as police chief is also good  vasanthi is a name and actress to look out for  i can t say anything else about that   post intermission there are a few big twists and reveals that we never see coming  never  and they are all done so well  so smooth  the 2h 26m runtime feels like a breeze  kudos to editor philomin raj  spectacular editing as the movie is quite fast paced  music director anirudh ravichandran could be considered as a hero of the movie as well because if it wasn t for his music bgm  vikram would never be elevated to this level  what a badass backgroud score  even when it s not about action on screen  it is already my new ringtone  the title track  incorporating the  vikram vikram  theme from the original 1986 movie is outstanding  as well as the melodius number  porkanda singham      pathala pathala  is a fun song to watch  though i am not a big fan of that one  whenever there is a scene where kamal has to walk towards or away from the screen  the vikram     vikram   title song pops up and it s goosebumps   wow  action by anbariv   the stunt choreographer duo anbu   arivu is a class apart  creative  unique and violent at times  there are certain action scenes that we have never seen before  awesome lokesh is a kamal fanboy and this is his fanboy moment  but what differentiates him from others is that inspite of all these 3 acting powerhouses together  it is still a lokesh kanakaraj movie  he did not have to conform to the mega stars  image  which is exactly why the movie  beast didn t work as it should have  lokesh has set the groundwork for a new cinematic universe with more sequels in the pipeline  next could be kaithi 2 or a vikram 3 or both  after watching vikram  thinking about the possibility of karthi  kamal  fahad and surya together in one movie peaks my interest so much  there are so many stories to be told  so many angles to be thought of  kamal already hinted at a full fledged movie with surya and him together  awesome  kamal  fahad and vijay sethupathi played their roles to perfection vikram is a well designed ode to kamal haasan  a kick ass  adrenaline fuelled ode that deserves the blockbuster label it is now garnering watch vikram in cinemas to get the full effect of a mass action movie  but brush up on kaithi too before that  enjoy  ,4.0,7348,so much excitement for vikram based on a character of the same name from the 1986 movie vikram who was a raw agent the basic story here goes as amar fahad and his team of black squads take up the case of high profile murders serial killings that eventually leads them to santhanam vijay sethupathi a drug lord and the ghost realizing that everything isn t what it seems to be it s all out guns and glory from then on the buzz for vikram was there for a few years and then picked up momentum when the first teaser was released almost one and half years ago the first teaser was just that a tease director lokesh kanakaraj said in an interview before the release of vikram that the teaser scenes were just shot to create a buzz among people it had nothing to do with the actual movie though it gave us a taste of how the movie would be the excitement peaked while watching with an audience comprising mostly of tamilians and a some malayalis hoots whistles cheers claps it was a wild ride on and off screen it was great to see that both tamilians and malayalis shouted out for both malayalam and tamil actors alike no discrimination pure love for the actors just euphoria this is one of the most stylish mass action thriller movies out there now and it has incited mass hysteria among the audience as well one of lokesh s best though his maanagaram will always be my favorite followed by kaithi kaithi was a ground breaking gangster movie so fast paced almost shot completely at night on the road out and out action with a sentimental thread of a father and daughter yearning to meet each other actor karthi was awesome as dilli now those who haven t watched kaithi must check it out as it too has connections with this new vikram you can say lokesh is creating his own cinematic universe the lkcu or lcu he has created a script that makes vikram an extension of the movie kaithi vikram is one of those rare movies that has stayed true to its genre and trailers you watch the trailer you get an idea of what you will be watching and you get exactly that and more with utmost satisfaction that is quite rare nowadays as most trailers pump you up but the movie fizzles out some scenes remind you of a quentin tarantino robert rodriguez martin scorcese scorcese is one of lokesh s favourite hollywood director style of movie making which is not bad at all because it results in visually stunning action scenes and set pieces the movie has some of the most gruesome and creative kills and gore for an indian movie with excellent cinematography by our very own girish gangadharan who is also a national film award winner for best cinematography for the 2019 film jallikkattu which itself is an insanely beautiful magical world captured on camera visually jallikattu was an immersive experience expected nothing less from ljp the magician girish gngadharan is also famous for his 11 minute single long take for the climax of the movie angamaly diaries another ljp movie coming to the actors fahad fazil is no stranger to intense characters his black squad agent amar is sharp dedicated and cold blooded as well his difficulty in maintaining a love life while keeping the nature of his job a secret seems so genuine the one who acts with his eyes fahad is in every way the perfect agent to step into kamal s shoes if ever the story takes that route fahad as always is terrific in his role probably a cake walk for him both fahad and kamal has those intense eyes that tell us a million stories with one look kamal haasan is back after a hiatus of almost 4 years vishwaroopam 2 was his last outing and it didn t do too well at the box office kamal once again proves why he is called ulaga nayagan universal hero at 67 he reprises his secret agent role from the 1986 movie vikram 36 years later though it s not ground breaking acting not needed here like some of his older famous characters the moment he enters the picture right from the beginning of the movie with the song pathala pathala you are mesmerized when kamal cries in a certain scene you feel it too once upon a time there lived a ghost who is the ghost i m not saying anything vijay sethupathi seemed to be having a lot of fun as drug kinkpin santhanam a recent drug bust rattles him up and he needs to find and get it back this is connected to the movie kaithi and that is all i will say about that but vijay sethupathi was also terrific pretty much straight forward bad guy with certain unique nuances a joy to watch and a sudden jolt of power inducing drug that he pops into his system in times of need kalidas jayaram had a minor role and he performed well surya as rolex in a cameo role around 5 mins stunned everyone he was fire on screen which resulted in the audience screming out at the top of their lungs for his mind blowing performance terror personified narain as bejoy also reprises his character from kaithi and did his part well chemban vinod jose as police chief is also good vasanthi is a name and actress to look out for i can t say anything else about that post intermission there are a few big twists and reveals that we never see coming never and they are all done so well so smooth the 2 h 26 m runtime feels like a breeze kudos to editor philomin raj spectacular editing as the movie is quite fast paced music director anirudh ravichandran could be considered as a hero of the movie as well because if it wasn t for his music bgm vikram would never be elevated to this level what a badass backgroud score even when it s not about action on screen it is already my new ringtone the title track incorporating the vikram vikram theme from the original 1986 movie is outstanding as well as the melodius number porkanda singham pathala pathala is a fun song to watch though i am not a big fan of that one whenever there is a scene where kamal has to walk towards or away from the screen the vikram vikram title song pops up and it s goosebumps wow action by anbariv the stunt choreographer duo anbu arivu is a class apart creative unique and violent at times there are certain action scenes that we have never seen before awesome lokesh is a kamal fanboy and this is his fanboy moment but what differentiates him from others is that inspite of all these 3 acting powerhouses together it is still a lokesh kanakaraj movie he did not have to conform to the mega stars image which is exactly why the movie beast didn t work as it should have lokesh has set the groundwork for a new cinematic universe with more sequels in the pipeline next could be kaithi 2 or a vikram 3 or both after watching vikram thinking about the possibility of karthi kamal fahad and surya together in one movie peaks my interest so much there are so many stories to be told so many angles to be thought of kamal already hinted at a full fledged movie with surya and him together awesome kamal fahad and vijay sethupathi played their roles to perfection vikram is a well designed ode to kamal haasan a kick ass adrenaline fuelled ode that deserves the blockbuster label it is now garnering watch vikram in cinemas to get the full effect of a mass action movie but brush up on kaithi too before that enjoy,3,Positive

280,djpa-76657,1 August 2022, till date i ve watched the film more than 5 6 times  twice in theatres and rest on disney hotstar and yet i m not over this drug  the addiction level to this film is damn high  i guess i need to write a review about this film which will calm me down well the moment i heard about this film my excitement level reached sky limits not only because it was a kamal hassan comeback film that too directed by my new favourite director lokesh kanagraj but also because the film also starred 2 of my favourite actors in india  fahadh faasil and vijay sethupathi  i watched the trailer and that immediately intrigued me what the plot will be all about  hence i went to theatres without any friend of family member of mine and watched the movie with few people around as here in hindi belt very few knew about vikram releasing  all thanks to absolute garbage film samrat prithviraj taking over the screens  and i was blown away within few minutes of the film  it was literally a follow up to loki s previous blockbuster kaithi  why was this kept a secret from the audience  lokesh kanagraj already established a cinematic verse with kaithi and continued with vikram yet no one knew about it  that was a complain i had but who cared in hindi belt what was going on  i wished vikram had same level of marketing that baahubali series  rrr and kgf 2 had and same hype around audience in mumbai plot  within first few minutes of the film kamal hassan s character supposedly died and fahadh faasil starts his investigation around series of deaths and that keeps you hooked completely  i was blown away by the fact that fahadh had dubbed for his own voice in hindi  didn t know he spoke hindi that well  now i really hope to see him in some bollywood film  not in side role but a lead role that ll justify his talent  as the story unfolds very little references to kaithi was shown in the film  but the hindi dubbing part pretty much annoyed me as in kaithi they changed the characters  name from bejoy to arjun or dili to shiva but in vikram they retained the og names instead of dubbing them as well  why would those dubbing studios or dubbing directors do that   they retained og names from kaithi in vikram but decided to change vijay sethupathi s name from sanhdanam to chandan  now in the future what am i supposed to call karthi  narain  sethupathi arjun das or harish uthaman in future movies  their dubbed names or og names  the continuity can t be blamed on lokesh kanagraj because it s fault with hindi distributors how they ruin the fun  but that was easily avoided by first time viewers as no one had any idea about kaithi in my theatre hence i took the enjoyment in the narrative  how the investigation unfolded  one by one every interesting character was introduced with faasil leading the film from the front while vijay sethupathi seemed to be having a supporting role although his entry was whistle worthy  perhaps the best entry in the film unlike many heroes having lean or 6 pack abs shirtless entry  here the makkal selvan appeared bare body with flabs coming out and seemingly enjoyed the film like nobody else had done  that was the evil entry  and as the film reached interval point  vjs and fafa were as excited and shocked as us audience when the universal hero appeared onscreen after a kickass action  and fro  that point kamal hassan took over the film and what followed was madness and mayhem presented by the mad genius lokesh kanagraj  how vikram and his team fights out the drug cartel led by chandan vjs  with amar fafa  joining the fight after taking a backseat performances  before i get to the trinity of acting prowess i d like to talk more about support cast  the one who stole the show with only one scene  vasanthi as agent tina  the action she did  with fork knives spoons and tried her best to save vikram s family was whistle worthy  that scene alone made me hoot for the film every time i watched it  agent tina was easily the best support character in this film  the very next best supporting role came from maya s krishnan as the escort  those scenes were hilarious and brought the house down  well supported by anirudh s bgm i ll come to that part soon   chemban vinod jose did well as police chief who was surprisingly one of the antagonist of this film  besides other agents  chandan s men  narain as inspector bejoy and other vikram s team members did well as per their part with jabir sadiq emerging as another highlight due to the fear he brought in cutting leg  especially during kamal hassan time now i ll come to the lead performers  fafa was the main man in first half  it became out and out fahadh faasil show in first half of vikram and in some scenes even overshadowed the ulaga nayagan in his own film  he didn t have any quirks like vjs and kamal hassan did but stood tall in his performance leading the film well and kept us hook only through his acting  if anyone asks me who is the best actor of india in today s generation i won t say ranbir  ranveer  vicky kaushal or ayushmann khurrana  the name is one and only fahadh faasil  while fafa lead the first half well  vjs brought the house down with his screen presence itself  despite playing another villain he gave new dimension in his performance  this time the entry scene  his own take as contemporary hero till the villainous avatar took his place and the fear he showed humbled his character well enough which had too many shades and performer like vjs was surely gonna nail it  he s the makkal selvan the people s own treasure  now i ve talked about my favourite stars  let s talk about their favourite  the universal hero  the ulaga nayagan  the kamal hassan  he s 60   almost 70 year old man and he was the vikram he carried from his old film of same name  same character and same swag  kamal hassan in second half is what this film truly is all about  my dad and mom used to be big kh fans and i never had cared about him but after vikram i m eagerly dying to see his other films in tamil as well  not just the old hindi ones that i ve watched  he s easily amongst the best actors in the world  imagine putting al pacino and sylvester stallone into one roll  yup that s who kamal hassan is  and while these 3 weren t enough  here comes the screaming cameo of rolex bhai  suriya  it was well teased earlier suriya is going to have a cameo in this film  just not what i had expected  i thought it ll be some starry cameo or for the sake of audience  but instead it became an uproar of him playing the ultimate antagonist of lokesh cinematic universe  bringing kaithi and vikram rolled into one big universe lokesh kanagraj created  if ironman karthi as dilli  is already in this mess  captain america kamal hassan  and thor fafa  already dealt with loki vjs  than now they re ready to face the ultimate thanos suriya  in the madness created by the lokesh kanagraj himself  can t wait to see how the universe unfolds  especially the battle of brothers  karthi vs suriya while the 3 pillars above are covered up well enough  we cannot forget the fourth pillar of this film  aniruddh  the bgm provided for almost every character and every situation is as addictive as a drug and uplifts the film well  the vikram remixed  vjs entry and fight scenes  amar s own music  the escort bgm how smartly that was used needs unanimous hoots  and of course the rolex music as cherry on cake  amongst all of them once upon a time there lived a ghost emerges as my favourite  i ve made sure even my family watches this film again and again and they did  totally love it as hell  the scene in which kh fafa and vjs were facing each other is easily amongst the best face off in indian film industry ever  just wished a proper face off between amar and chandan  but vikram was enough for chandan to face  going with all 10 stars  only wished hindi dubbing was as good if not better than rrr kgf films  ,5.0,7892,till

297,jothishprabu,3 April 2023, i solely went to watch this flick because of all the hype  mostly surrounding lokesh and it s a kamal hasan film  which we hadn t experienced for a long time  the director seem to have built a cult fandom for himself with just 4 movies under his belt which says a lot  i personally have only watched master prior to this and didn t see anything new in it  in fact i found the movie to be very forgettable  it s mostly just another vijay masala flick for vijay fanboys  no offence but that s just how it is i went into vikram with mild expectations but boy was i surprised  with this movie  i can confidently say that lokesh has finally found his own style  i will point out the pros real quick because i only want to elaborate on the cons pros  1  score by anirudh  truly astounding   2  cinematography 3  fight choreography  especially the robot camera scenes  i really hadn t seen such camera moves even in hollywood so kudos to the stunt and camera team   4  sethupathy s acting   the character could been very generic but the actor realised his role very well 5  violence very bloody and intense scenes which i found to be a very ballsy decision by the director to go full on nuts   6  character twists the reveals with title cards if you know what i mean  7  final boss reveal  watchbrand  cons  1  extended runtime  15   20 mins could have been taken out with tighter editing cause i could really feel the runtime at certain places 2  related to kaithi  yes  i know that lokesh is trying to build his own mcu but the connection to kaithi felt really convoluted and unnecessary to the main plot  the beach scene  the theatre kidnap scene and many more didn t make much sense  i wish the story just stuck to amar investigating about vikram s suspicious death and him learning about the link between sandhanam and vikram 3  bejoy  this is also related to my previous point  the director fails to communicate who this guy is and why he is so important to this movie  i also found his whole speech in jail to be cringeworthy and pretentious 4  dumb character decisions a  why dafuq did amar decide to blow up sandhanam s house  isn t he supposed to be a good guy  i mean if you really want to catch sandhanam by the balls  you only go after him and his business  blowing up his whole frikin house would make you a criminal  i mean there are like 30 40 people living in that house including innocent children      i lost all sympathy and support for amar when he made this dumb decision  also  the movie doesn t really shows us how exactly did his team placed the explosives without anyone knowing lmfao  b  when time is of the essence  why on earth would you run barefoot to a location where your girlfriend is being held captive to be possibly killed      taking an auto would have saved him so much time  he could have probably prevented an unnecessary death c  very early on  we understand that vikram s grandchild is intolerable to loud noises  which could possibly kill him  in the climax  when there is literally a war going on  i don t really think the anc headphones would have protected the baby s ears  i mean just the sound from the minigun would have killed the baby    in the end  i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who s looking for some good r rated action but it could have been so much better with a more refined

other characters dumb   that was happens in big star movies but here the director writer managed to break that stereotype  he gave all the goosebumps moments to kamal hassan and also gave the other stunning moments to fafa and vjs equally  infact kamal allowed fafa and vjs to dominate the first half and he arrives at the interval and the steals the moment the problem i found was with an

looked like kokki kumar s entry in  vai raja vai    in lokesh kanagaraj s version  nothing impactful  overall vikram lived upto it s expectations and the buzz it created  an outstanding raw action

398,architectddeepika,5 June 2022, warning trigger alert  the below review consists of statements which shares disturbing content that includes topics such as violence  blood shed  physical abuse etc  in the extremely competitive thick forest  i repeat  that the lion  tiger and leopard have won audiences with their performances which seems to be challenging each other  packing the first 30 minutes with huge blocks of perplexing data was kind of an overloading visual play  which was quite difficult to process  as and when you start to waver  or try to clasp the events that unfold  that s when these three legends attempt to give you the hang of it  until the fast pace settles down in an understandable track  in such a hypnotic way that gets you addicted and you cannot tear your eyes off them this movie is a rapid racer script  sprinkled with intermittent goosebump moments  to ease off the high pressure  steam   tension  the light hearted humorous moments gives the audience  a much needed break there are so many shocking twists   implausible turns in this crime drenched plot which brands  vikram  so intriguing   electrifying to watch  i don t want to reveal anything because i felt that being one among the audience who thoroughly enjoyed the look  feel   make of this movie  selfishly desire that the person reading this should also experience that joy  as their very own to

,4.0,5490,warning trigger alert the below review consists of statements which shares disturbing content that includes topics such as violence blood shed physical abuse etc in the extremely competitive thick forest i repeat that the lion tiger and leopard have won audiences with their performances which seems to be challenging each other packing the first 30 minutes with huge blocks of perplexing data was kind of an overloading visual play which was quite difficult to process as and when you start to waver or try to clasp the events that unfold that s when these three legends attempt to give you the hang of it until the fast pace settles down in an understandable track in such a hypnotic way that gets you addicted and you cannot tear your eyes off them this movie is a rapid racer script sprinkled with intermittent goosebump moments to ease off the high pressure steam tension the light hearted humorous moments gives the audience a much needed break there are so many shocking twists implausible turns in this crime drenched plot which brands vikram so intriguing electrifying to watch i don t want to reveal anything because i felt that being one among the audience who thoroughly

cameo appearance by kalidas jayaram has a strong impact to the story  another powerful cameo by actor surya is a surprise element to this high octane thriller  only a 3   4 minutes of his screen
